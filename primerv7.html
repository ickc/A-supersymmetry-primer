<p>[]<span>0.86</span> I provide a pedagogical introduction to supersymmetry. The level of discussion is aimed at readers who are familiar with the Standard Model and quantum field theory, but who have had little or no prior exposure to supersymmetry. Topics covered include: motivations for supersymmetry, the construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians, superspace and superfields, soft supersymmetry-breaking interactions, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity and its consequences, the origins of supersymmetry breaking, the mass spectrum of the MSSM, decays of supersymmetric particles, experimental signals for supersymmetry, and some extensions of the minimal framework.</p>

<h1 id="sec:intro"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The Standard Model of high-energy physics, augmented by neutrino masses, provides a remarkably successful description of presently known phenomena. The experimental frontier has advanced into the TeV range with no unambiguous hints of additional structure. Still, it seems clear that the Standard Model is a work in progress and will have to be extended to describe physics at higher energies. Certainly, a new framework will be required at the reduced Planck scale <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}= (8 \pi G_{\rm Newton})^{-1/2} = 2.4 \times 10^{18}\)</span> GeV, where quantum gravitational effects become important. Based only on a proper respect for the power of Nature to surprise us, it seems nearly as obvious that new physics exists in the 16 orders of magnitude in energy between the presently explored territory near the electroweak scale, <span class="math inline">\(M_W\)</span>, and the Planck scale.</p>
<p>The mere fact that the ratio <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}/M_W\)</span> is so huge is already a powerful clue to the character of physics beyond the Standard Model, because of the infamous “hierarchy problem” <span class="citation" data-cites="hierarchyproblem">@hierarchyproblem</span>. This is not really a difficulty with the Standard Model itself, but rather a disturbing sensitivity of the Higgs potential to new physics in almost any imaginable extension of the Standard Model. The electrically neutral part of the Standard Model Higgs field is a complex scalar <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> with a classical potential <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V = m_H^2 |H|^2 + {\lambda} |H|^4\&gt; .
\label{higgspotential}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The Standard Model requires a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (VEV) for <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> at the minimum of the potential. This occurs if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2 &lt; 0\)</span>, resulting in <span class="math inline">\(\langle H \rangle = \sqrt{-m_H^2/2\lambda}\)</span>. We know experimentally that <span class="math inline">\(\langle H \rangle\)</span> is approximately 174 GeV from measurements of the properties of the weak interactions. The 2012 discovery <span class="citation" data-cites="Higgsdiscovery">@Higgsdiscovery</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Higgsmass">@Higgsmass</span> of the Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV implies that, assuming the Standard Model is correct as an effective field theory, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.126\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2 = -(\mbox{92.9 GeV})^2\)</span>. (These are running <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm MS}}\)</span> parameters evaluated at a renormalization scale equal to the top-quark mass, and include the effects of 2-loop corrections.) The problem is that <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> receives enormous quantum corrections from the virtual effects of every particle or other phenomenon that couples, directly or indirectly, to the Higgs field.</p>
<p>For example, in Figure [fig:higgscorr1]a we have a correction to <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> from a loop containing a Dirac fermion <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with mass <span class="math inline">\(m_f\)</span>.</p>
<p>(108,63)(-54,-27) (-55,0)(-22,0)<span>4</span> (55,0)(22,0)<span>4</span> (0,0)(22,0,360) (-50,7)[c]<span><span class="math inline">\(H\)</span></span> (0,32)[c]<span><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span></span> (0,-34.5)[c]<span>(a)</span></p>
<p>(108,63)(-54,-27) (0,37)[c]<span><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span></span> (-41,-5)[c]<span><span class="math inline">\(H\)</span></span> (-46,-12)(46,-12)<span>4</span> (0,8)(20,-90,270)<span>5</span> (0,-34.5)[c]<span>(b)</span></p>
<p>If the Higgs field couples to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with a term in the Lagrangian <span class="math inline">\(-\lambda_f H {\overline}f f\)</span>, then the Feynman diagram in Figure [fig:higgscorr1]a yields a correction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m_H^2 \&gt;=\&gt;  
-{|\lambda_f|^2\over 8 \pi^2} \Lambda_{\rm UV}^2 + \ldots .
\label{quaddiv1}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> is an ultraviolet momentum cutoff used to regulate the loop integral; it should be interpreted as at least the energy scale at which new physics enters to alter the high-energy behavior of the theory. The ellipses represent terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_f^2\)</span>, which grow at most logarithmically with <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> (and actually differ for the real and imaginary parts of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>). Each of the leptons and quarks of the Standard Model can play the role of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>; for quarks, eq. ([quaddiv1]) should be multiplied by 3 to account for color. The largest correction comes when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the top quark with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_f\approx 0.94\)</span>. The problem is that if <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> is of order <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, say, then this quantum correction to <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> is some 30 orders of magnitude larger than the required value of <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2 \approx -(92.9\)</span> GeV<span class="math inline">\()^2\)</span>. This is only directly a problem for corrections to the Higgs scalar boson squared mass, because quantum corrections to fermion and gauge boson masses do not have the direct quadratic sensitivity to <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> found in eq. ([quaddiv1]). However, the quarks and leptons and the electroweak gauge bosons <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W^\pm\)</span> of the Standard Model all obtain masses from <span class="math inline">\(\langle H \rangle\)</span>, so that the entire mass spectrum of the Standard Model is directly or indirectly sensitive to the cutoff <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span>.</p>
<p>One could imagine that the solution is to simply pick a <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> that is not too large. But then one still must concoct some new physics at the scale <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> that not only alters the propagators in the loop, but actually cuts off the loop integral. This is not easy to do in a theory whose Lagrangian does not contain more than two derivatives, and higher-derivative theories generally suffer from a failure of either unitarity or causality <span class="citation" data-cites="EliezerWoodard">@EliezerWoodard</span>. In string theories, loop integrals are nevertheless cut off at high Euclidean momentum <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by factors <span class="math inline">\(e^{-p^2/\Lambda^2_{\rm UV}}\)</span>. However, then <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> is a string scale that is usually<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> thought to be not very far below <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are contributions similar to eq. ([quaddiv1]) from the virtual effects of any heavy particles that might exist, and these involve the masses of the heavy particles (or other high physical mass scales), not just the cutoff. It cannot be overemphasized that merely choosing a regulator with no quadratic divergences does <span><em>not</em></span> address the hierarchy problem. The problem is not really the quadratic divergences, but rather the quadratic sensitivity to high mass scales. The latter are correlated with quadratic divergences for some, but not all, choices of ultraviolet regulator. The absence of quadratic divergences is a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion for avoiding the hierarchy problem.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there exists a heavy complex scalar particle <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with mass <span class="math inline">\(m_S\)</span> that couples to the Higgs with a Lagrangian term $ -_S |H|^2 |S|^2$. Then the Feynman diagram in Figure [fig:higgscorr1]b gives a correction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m_H^2 \&gt;=\&gt; {\lambda_S\over 16 \pi^2}
\left [\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2 - 2 m_S^2
\&gt; {\rm ln}(\Lambda_{\rm UV}/m_S) + \ldots
\right ].
\label{quaddiv2}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> If one rejects the possibility of a physical interpretation of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> and uses dimensional regularization on the loop integral instead of a momentum cutoff, then there will be no <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2\)</span> piece. However, even then the term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_S^2\)</span> cannot be eliminated without the physically unjustifiable tuning of a counter-term specifically for that purpose. This illustrates that <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> is sensitive to the masses of the <span><em>heaviest</em></span> particles that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> couples to; if <span class="math inline">\(m_S\)</span> is very large, its effects on the Standard Model do not decouple, but instead make it difficult to understand why <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> is so small.</p>
<p>This problem arises even if there is no direct coupling between the Standard Model Higgs boson and the unknown heavy particles. For example, suppose there exists a heavy fermion <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> that, unlike the quarks and leptons of the Standard Model, has vectorlike quantum numbers and therefore gets a large mass <span class="math inline">\(m_F\)</span> without coupling to the Higgs field. [In other words, an arbitrarily large mass term of the form <span class="math inline">\(m_F \overline F F\)</span> is not forbidden by any symmetry, including weak isospin <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>.] In that case, no diagram like Figure [fig:higgscorr1]a exists for <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Nevertheless there will be a correction to <span class="math inline">\(m_H^2\)</span> as long as <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> shares some gauge interactions with the Standard Model Higgs field; these may be the familiar electroweak interactions, or some unknown gauge forces that are broken at a very high energy scale inaccessible to experiment. In either case, the two-loop Feynman diagrams in Figure [fig:higgscorr2] yield a correction</p>

+ \ldots \right ],
\label{quaddiv3}\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C_H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_F\)</span> are group theory factors<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> of order 1, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the appropriate gauge coupling. The coefficient <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> depends on the method used to cut off the momentum integrals. It does not arise at all if one uses dimensional regularization, but the <span class="math inline">\(m_F^2\)</span> contribution is always present with the given coefficient. The numerical factor <span class="math inline">\((g^2/16 \pi^2)^2\)</span> may be quite small (of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{-5}\)</span> for electroweak interactions), but the important point is that these contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2\)</span> are sensitive both to the largest masses and to the physical ultraviolet cutoff in the theory, presumably of order <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. The “natural” squared mass of a fundamental Higgs scalar, including quantum corrections, therefore seems to be more like <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}^2\)</span> than the experimental value. Even very indirect contributions from Feynman diagrams with three or more loops can give unacceptably large contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2\)</span>. The argument above applies not just for heavy particles, but for arbitrary high-scale physical phenomena such as condensates or additional compactified dimensions.</p>
<p>It could be that the Higgs boson field is not fundamental, but rather is the result of a composite field or collective phenomenon. Such ideas are certainly still worth exploring, although they typically present difficulties in their simplest forms. In particular, so far the 125 GeV Higgs boson does appear to have properties consistent with a fundamental scalar field. Or, it could be that the ultimate ultraviolet cutoff scale, and therefore the mass scales of all presently undiscovered particles and condensates, are much lower than the Planck scale. But, if the Higgs boson is a fundamental particle, and there really is physics far above the electroweak scale, then we have two remaining options: either we must make the rather bizarre assumption that <span><em>none</em></span> of the high-mass particles or condensates couple (even indirectly or extremely weakly) to the Higgs scalar field, or else some striking cancellation is needed between the various contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The systematic cancellation of the dangerous contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2\)</span> can only be brought about by the type of conspiracy that is better known to physicists as a symmetry. Comparing eqs. ([quaddiv1]) and ([quaddiv2]) strongly suggests that the new symmetry ought to relate fermions and bosons, because of the relative minus sign between fermion loop and boson loop contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2\)</span>. (Note that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_S\)</span> must be positive if the scalar potential is to be bounded from below.) If each of the quarks and leptons of the Standard Model is accompanied by two complex scalars with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_S = |\lambda_f|^2\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2\)</span> contributions of Figures [fig:higgscorr1]a and [fig:higgscorr1]b will neatly cancel <span class="citation" data-cites="quadscancel">@quadscancel</span>. Clearly, more restrictions on the theory will be necessary to ensure that this success persists to higher orders, so that, for example, the contributions in Figure [fig:higgscorr2] and eq. ([quaddiv3]) from a very heavy fermion are canceled by the two-loop effects of some very heavy bosons. Fortunately, the cancellation of all such contributions to scalar masses is not only possible, but is actually unavoidable, once we merely assume that there exists a symmetry relating fermions and bosons, called a <span><em>supersymmetry</em></span>.</p>
<p>A supersymmetry transformation turns a bosonic state into a fermionic state, and vice versa. The operator <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> that generates such transformations must be an anti-commuting spinor, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
Q |{\rm Boson}\rangle = |{\rm Fermion }\rangle, \qquad\qquad
Q |{\rm Fermion}\rangle = |{\rm Boson }\rangle .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Spinors are intrinsically complex objects, so <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> (the hermitian conjugate of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>) is also a symmetry generator. Because <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> are fermionic operators, they carry spin angular momentum 1/2, so it is clear that supersymmetry must be a spacetime symmetry. The possible forms for such symmetries in an interacting quantum field theory are highly restricted by the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius extension <span class="citation" data-cites="HLS">@HLS</span> of the Coleman-Mandula theorem <span class="citation" data-cites="ColemanMandula">@ColemanMandula</span>. For realistic theories that, like the Standard Model, have chiral fermions (i.e., fermions whose left- and right-handed pieces transform differently under the gauge group) and thus the possibility of parity-violating interactions, this theorem implies that the generators <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> must satisfy an algebra of anticommutation and commutation relations with the schematic form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;\{ Q, Q^\dagger \} = P^\mu , \label{susyalgone}
\\
&amp;&amp;\{ Q,Q \} = \{ Q^\dagger , Q^\dagger \} = 0 , \label{susyalgtwo}
\\
&amp;&amp;[ P^\mu , Q  ] = [P^\mu, Q^\dagger ] = 0 ,\label{susyalgthree}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P^\mu\)</span> is the four-momentum generator of spacetime translations. Here we have ruthlessly suppressed the spinor indices on <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span>; after developing some notation we will, in section [subsec:susylagr.freeWZ], derive the precise version of eqs. ([susyalgone])-([susyalgthree]) with indices restored. In the meantime, we simply note that the appearance of <span class="math inline">\(P^\mu\)</span> on the right-hand side of eq. ([susyalgone]) is unsurprising, because it transforms under Lorentz boosts and rotations as a spin-1 object while <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> on the left-hand side each transform as spin-1/2 objects.</p>
<p>The single-particle states of a supersymmetric theory fall into irreducible representations of the supersymmetry algebra, called <span><em>supermultiplets</em></span>. Each supermultiplet contains both fermion and boson states, which are commonly known as <span><em>superpartners</em></span> of each other. By definition, if <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega^\prime \rangle\)</span> are members of the same supermultiplet, then <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega^\prime\rangle\)</span> is proportional to some combination of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({Q^\dagger}\)</span> operators acting on $|$, up to a spacetime translation or rotation. The squared-mass operator <span class="math inline">\({\ominus}P^2\)</span> commutes with the operators <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({Q^\dagger}\)</span>, and with all spacetime rotation and translation operators, so it follows immediately that particles inhabiting the same irreducible supermultiplet must have equal eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\({\ominus}P^2\)</span>, and therefore equal masses.</p>
<p>The supersymmetry generators <span class="math inline">\(Q,Q^\dagger\)</span> also commute with the generators of gauge transformations. Therefore particles in the same supermultiplet must also be in the same representation of the gauge group, and so must have the same electric charges, weak isospin, and color degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Each supermultiplet contains an equal number of fermion and boson degrees of freedom. To prove this, consider the operator <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the spin angular momentum. By the spin-statistics theorem, this operator has eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> acting on a bosonic state and eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> acting on a fermionic state. Any fermionic operator will turn a bosonic state into a fermionic state and vice versa. Therefore <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s}\)</span> must anticommute with every fermionic operator in the theory, and in particular with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span>. Now, within a given supermultiplet, consider the subspace of states <span class="math inline">\(| i \rangle\)</span> with the same eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(p^\mu\)</span> of the four-momentum operator <span class="math inline">\(P^\mu\)</span>. In view of eq. ([susyalgthree]), any combination of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> must give another state <span class="math inline">\(|i^\prime\rangle\)</span> with the same four-momentum eigenvalue. Therefore one has a completeness relation <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i |i\rangle\langle i | = 1\)</span> within this subspace of states. Now one can take a trace over all such states of the operator <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s} P^\mu\)</span> (including each spin helicity state separately): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} P^\mu | i \rangle
&amp;=&amp;
\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q Q^\dagger|i\rangle
+\sum_i\langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q^\dagger Q | i \rangle
\nonumber\\
&amp;=&amp;
\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q Q^\dagger | i \rangle
+ \sum_i \sum_j \langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q^\dagger |j \rangle \langle j | Q
| i \rangle\qquad{}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=&amp;
\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q Q^\dagger | i \rangle +
\sum_j \langle j | Q (-1)^{2s}  Q^\dagger | j \rangle
\nonumber\\
&amp;=&amp;\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} Q Q^\dagger | i \rangle -
\sum_j \langle j |  (-1)^{2s} Q Q^\dagger | j \rangle
\nonumber \\
&amp;=&amp; 0.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first equality follows from the supersymmetry algebra relation eq. ([susyalgone]); the second and third from use of the completeness relation; and the fourth from the fact that <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s}\)</span> must anticommute with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i \langle i | (-1)^{2s} P^\mu | i \rangle = \, p^\mu\)</span> Tr[<span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s}\)</span>] is just proportional to the number of bosonic degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(n_B\)</span> minus the number of fermionic degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(n_F\)</span> in the trace, so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
n_B= n_F
\label{nbnf}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> must hold for a given <span class="math inline">\(p^\mu\not= 0\)</span> in each supermultiplet.</p>
<p>The simplest possibility for a supermultiplet consistent with eq. ([nbnf]) has a single Weyl fermion (with two spin helicity states, so <span class="math inline">\(n_F=2\)</span>) and two real scalars (each with <span class="math inline">\(n_B=1\)</span>). It is natural to assemble the two real scalar degrees of freedom into a complex scalar field; as we will see below this provides for convenient formulations of the supersymmetry algebra, Feynman rules, supersymmetry-violating effects, etc. This combination of a two-component Weyl fermion and a complex scalar field is called a <span><em>chiral</em></span> or <span><em>matter</em></span> or <span><em>scalar</em></span> supermultiplet.</p>
<p>The next-simplest possibility for a supermultiplet contains a spin-1 vector boson. If the theory is to be renormalizable, this must be a gauge boson that is massless, at least before the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. A massless spin-1 boson has two helicity states, so the number of bosonic degrees of freedom is <span class="math inline">\(n_B=2\)</span>. Its superpartner is therefore a massless spin-1/2 Weyl fermion, again with two helicity states, so <span class="math inline">\(n_F=2\)</span>. (If one tried to use a massless spin-3/2 fermion instead, the theory would not be renormalizable.) Gauge bosons must transform as the adjoint representation of the gauge group, so their fermionic partners, called <span><em>gauginos</em></span>, must also. Because the adjoint representation of a gauge group is always its own conjugate, the gaugino fermions must have the same gauge transformation properties for left-handed and for right-handed components. Such a combination of spin-1/2 gauginos and spin-1 gauge bosons is called a <span><em>gauge</em></span> or <span><em>vector</em></span> supermultiplet.</p>
<p>If we include gravity, then the spin-2 graviton (with 2 helicity states, so <span class="math inline">\(n_B=2\)</span>) has a spin-<span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> superpartner called the gravitino. The gravitino would be massless if supersymmetry were unbroken, and so it has <span class="math inline">\(n_F=2\)</span> helicity states.</p>
<p>There are other possible combinations of particles with spins that can satisfy eq. ([nbnf]). However, these are always reducible to combinations<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> of chiral and gauge supermultiplets if they have renormalizable interactions, except in certain theories with “extended” supersymmetry. Theories with extended supersymmetry have more than one distinct copy of the supersymmetry generators <span class="math inline">\(Q,{Q^\dagger}\)</span>. Such models are mathematically interesting, but evidently do not have any phenomenological prospects. The reason is that extended supersymmetry in four-dimensional field theories cannot allow for chiral fermions or parity violation as observed in the Standard Model. So we will not discuss such possibilities further, although extended supersymmetry in higher-dimensional field theories might describe the real world if the extra dimensions are compactified in an appropriate way, and extended supersymmetry in four dimensions provides interesting toy models and calculation tools. The ordinary, non-extended, phenomenologically viable type of supersymmetric model is sometimes called <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> supersymmetry, with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> referring to the number of supersymmetries (the number of distinct copies of <span class="math inline">\(Q, {Q^\dagger}\)</span>).</p>
<p>In a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model <span class="citation" data-cites="FayetHsnu">@FayetHsnu</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Rparity">@Rparity</span>, each of the known fundamental particles is therefore in either a chiral or gauge supermultiplet, and must have a superpartner with spin differing by 1/2 unit. The first step in understanding the exciting phenomenological consequences of this prediction is to decide exactly how the known particles fit into supermultiplets, and to give them appropriate names. A crucial observation here is that only chiral supermultiplets can contain fermions whose left-handed parts transform differently under the gauge group than their right-handed parts. All of the Standard Model fermions (the known quarks and leptons) have this property, so they must be members of chiral supermultiplets. The bosonic partners of the quarks and leptons therefore must be spin-0, and not spin-1 vector bosons.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The names for the spin-0 partners of the quarks and leptons are constructed by prepending an “s”, for scalar. So, generically they are called <span> <em>squarks</em></span> and <span><em>sleptons</em></span> (short for “scalar quark” and “scalar lepton”), or sometimes <span><em>sfermions</em></span>. The left-handed and right-handed pieces of the quarks and leptons are separate two-component Weyl fermions with different gauge transformation properties in the Standard Model, so each must have its own complex scalar partner. The symbols for the squarks and sleptons are the same as for the corresponding fermion, but with a tilde (<span class="math inline">\(\phantom{.}{\widetilde}{\phantom{.}}\phantom{.}\)</span>) used to denote the superpartner of a Standard Model particle. For example, the superpartners of the left-handed and right-handed parts of the electron Dirac field are called left- and right-handed selectrons, and are denoted <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>. It is important to keep in mind that the “handedness” here does not refer to the helicity of the selectrons (they are spin-0 particles) but to that of their superpartners. A similar nomenclature applies for smuons and staus: <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>. The Standard Model neutrinos (neglecting their very small masses) are always left-handed, so the sneutrinos are denoted generically by <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu\)</span>, with a possible subscript indicating which lepton flavor they carry: <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\tau\)</span>. Finally, a complete list of the squarks is <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q_R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(q=u,d,s,c,b,t\)</span>. The gauge interactions of each of these squark and slepton fields are the same as for the corresponding Standard Model fermions; for instance, the left-handed squarks <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_L\)</span> couple to the <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> boson, while <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_R\)</span> do not.</p>
<p>It seems clear that the Higgs scalar boson must reside in a chiral supermultiplet, since it has spin 0. Actually, it turns out that just one chiral supermultiplet is not enough. One reason for this is that if there were only one Higgs chiral supermultiplet, the electroweak gauge symmetry would suffer a gauge anomaly, and would be inconsistent as a quantum theory. This is because the conditions for cancellation of gauge anomalies include $ {}[T_3^2 Y] = {}[Y^3] = 0, $ where <span class="math inline">\(T_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are the third component of weak isospin and the weak hypercharge, respectively, in a normalization where the ordinary electric charge is <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\rm EM} = T_3 + Y\)</span>. The traces run over all of the left-handed Weyl fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory. In the Standard Model, these conditions are already satisfied, somewhat miraculously, by the known quarks and leptons. Now, a fermionic partner of a Higgs chiral supermultiplet must be a weak isodoublet with weak hypercharge <span class="math inline">\(Y=1/2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y=-1/2\)</span>. In either case alone, such a fermion will make a non-zero contribution to the traces and spoil the anomaly cancellation. This can be avoided if there are two Higgs supermultiplets, one with each of <span class="math inline">\(Y=\pm 1/2\)</span>, so that the total contribution to the anomaly traces from the two fermionic members of the Higgs chiral supermultiplets vanishes by cancellation. As we will see in section [subsec:mssm.superpotential], both of these are also necessary for another completely different reason: because of the structure of supersymmetric theories, only a <span class="math inline">\(Y=1/2\)</span> Higgs chiral supermultiplet can have the Yukawa couplings necessary to give masses to charge <span class="math inline">\(+2/3\)</span> up-type quarks (up, charm, top), and only a <span class="math inline">\(Y=-1/2\)</span> Higgs can have the Yukawa couplings necessary to give masses to charge <span class="math inline">\(-1/3\)</span> down-type quarks (down, strange, bottom) and to the charged leptons.</p>
<p>We will call the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet complex scalar fields with <span class="math inline">\(Y=1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=-1/2\)</span> by the names <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span>, respectively.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The weak isospin components of <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(T_3=(1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>) have electric charges <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> respectively, and are denoted (<span class="math inline">\(H_u^+\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span>). Similarly, the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet complex scalar <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(T_3=(1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>) components (<span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_d^-\)</span>). The neutral scalar that corresponds to the physical Standard Model Higgs boson is in a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span>; we will discuss this further in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]. The generic nomenclature for a spin-1/2 superpartner is to append “-ino” to the name of the Standard Model particle, so the fermionic partners of the Higgs scalars are called higgsinos. They are denoted by <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_d\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet left-handed Weyl spinor fields, with weak isospin components <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_u^+\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_d^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_d^-\)</span>.</p>

<p>We have now found all of the chiral supermultiplets of a minimal phenomenologically viable extension of the Standard Model. They are summarized in Table [tab:chiral], classified according to their transformation properties under the Standard Model gauge group <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span>, which combines <span class="math inline">\(u_L,d_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu,e_L\)</span> degrees of freedom into <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> doublets. Here we follow a standard convention, that all chiral supermultiplets are defined in terms of left-handed Weyl spinors, so that the <span><em>conjugates</em></span> of the right-handed quarks and leptons (and their superpartners) appear in Table [tab:chiral]. This protocol for defining chiral supermultiplets turns out to be very useful for constructing supersymmetric Lagrangians, as we will see in section [sec:susylagr]. It is also useful to have a symbol for each of the chiral supermultiplets as a whole; these are indicated in the second column of Table [tab:chiral]. Thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> stands for the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet chiral supermultiplet containing <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_L,u_L\)</span> (with weak isospin component <span class="math inline">\(T_3=1/2\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_L, d_L\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(T_3=-1/2\)</span>), while <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u\)</span> stands for the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-singlet supermultiplet containing <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_R^*, u_R^\dagger\)</span>. There are three families for each of the quark and lepton supermultiplets, Table [tab:chiral] lists the first-family representatives. A family index <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2,3\)</span> can be affixed to the chiral supermultiplet names (<span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u_i, \ldots\)</span>) when needed, for example <span class="math inline">\(({\overline}e_1, {\overline}e_2, {\overline}e_3)= ({\overline}e, {\overline}\mu, {\overline}\tau)\)</span>. The bar on <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e\)</span> fields is part of the name, and does not denote any kind of conjugation.</p>
<p>The Higgs chiral supermultiplet <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> (containing <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_d^-\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_d^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}H_d^-\)</span>) has exactly the same Standard Model gauge quantum numbers as the left-handed sleptons and leptons <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span>, for example (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e_L\)</span>). Naively, one might therefore suppose that we could have been more economical in our assignment by taking a neutrino and a Higgs scalar to be superpartners, instead of putting them in separate supermultiplets. This would amount to the proposal that the Higgs boson and a sneutrino should be the same particle. This attempt played a key role in some of the first attempts to connect supersymmetry to phenomenology <span class="citation" data-cites="FayetHsnu">@FayetHsnu</span>, but it is now known to not work. Even ignoring the anomaly cancellation problem mentioned above, many insoluble phenomenological problems would result, including lepton-number non-conservation and a mass for at least one of the neutrinos in gross violation of experimental bounds. Therefore, all of the superpartners of Standard Model particles are really new particles, and cannot be identified with some other Standard Model state.</p>

<p>The vector bosons of the Standard Model clearly must reside in gauge supermultiplets. Their fermionic superpartners are generically referred to as gauginos. The <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> color gauge interactions of QCD are mediated by the gluon, whose spin-1/2 color-octet supersymmetric partner is the gluino. As usual, a tilde is used to denote the supersymmetric partner of a Standard Model state, so the symbols for the gluon and gluino are <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}g\)</span> respectively. The electroweak gauge symmetry <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\)</span> is associated with spin-1 gauge bosons <span class="math inline">\(W^+, W^0, W^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B^0\)</span>, with spin-1/2 superpartners <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^+, {\widetilde}W^0, {\widetilde}W^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B^0\)</span>, called <span><em>winos</em></span> and <span><em>bino</em></span>. After electroweak symmetry breaking, the <span class="math inline">\(W^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B^0\)</span> gauge eigenstates mix to give mass eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. The corresponding gaugino mixtures of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B^0\)</span> are called zino (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}Z^0\)</span>) and photino (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\gamma\)</span>); if supersymmetry were unbroken, they would be mass eigenstates with masses <span class="math inline">\(m_Z\)</span> and 0. Table [tab:gauge] summarizes the gauge supermultiplets of a minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.</p>
<p>The chiral and gauge supermultiplets in Tables [tab:chiral] and [tab:gauge] make up the particle content of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The most obvious and interesting feature of this theory is that none of the superpartners of the Standard Model particles has been discovered as of this writing. If supersymmetry were unbroken, then there would have to be selectrons <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span> with masses exactly equal to <span class="math inline">\(m_e = 0.511...\)</span> MeV. A similar statement applies to each of the other sleptons and squarks, and there would also have to be a massless gluino and photino. These particles would have been extraordinarily easy to detect long ago. Clearly, therefore, <span><em>supersymmetry is a broken symmetry</em></span> in the vacuum state chosen by Nature.</p>
<p>An important clue as to the nature of supersymmetry breaking can be obtained by returning to the motivation provided by the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry forced us to introduce two complex scalar fields for each Standard Model Dirac fermion, which is just what is needed to enable a cancellation of the quadratically sensitive <span class="math inline">\((\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2)\)</span> pieces of eqs. ([quaddiv1]) and ([quaddiv2]). This sort of cancellation also requires that the associated dimensionless couplings should be related (for example <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_S = |\lambda_f|^2\)</span>). The necessary relationships between couplings indeed occur in unbroken supersymmetry, as we will see in section [sec:susylagr]. In fact, unbroken supersymmetry guarantees that quadratic divergences in scalar squared masses, and therefore the quadratic sensitivity to high mass scales, must vanish to all orders in perturbation theory.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Now, if broken supersymmetry is still to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem even in the presence of supersymmetry breaking, then the relationships between dimensionless couplings that hold in an unbroken supersymmetric theory must be maintained. Otherwise, there would be quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the Higgs scalar masses of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m_H^2 = {1\over 8\pi^2} (\lambda_S - |\lambda_f|^2)
\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2 + \ldots .
\label{eq:royalewithcheese}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> We are therefore led to consider “soft” supersymmetry breaking. This means that the effective Lagrangian of the MSSM can be written in the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}= {{\cal L}}_{\rm SUSY} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm soft},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm SUSY}\)</span> contains all of the gauge and Yukawa interactions and preserves supersymmetry invariance, and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span> violates supersymmetry but contains only mass terms and coupling parameters with <span><em>positive</em></span> mass dimension. Without further justification, soft supersymmetry breaking might seem like a rather arbitrary requirement. Fortunately, we will see in section [sec:origins] that theoretical models for supersymmetry breaking do indeed yield effective Lagrangians with just such terms for <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span>. If the largest mass scale associated with the soft terms is denoted <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>, then the additional non-supersymmetric corrections to the Higgs scalar squared mass must vanish in the <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\rightarrow 0\)</span> limit, so by dimensional analysis they cannot be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2\)</span>. More generally, these models maintain the cancellation of quadratically divergent terms in the radiative corrections of all scalar masses, to all orders in perturbation theory. The corrections also cannot go like <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_H^2 \sim m_{\rm soft} \Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span>, because in general the loop momentum integrals always diverge either quadratically or logarithmically, not linearly, as <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV} \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. So they must be of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m_{H}^2 =
m_{\rm soft}^2
\left [{\lambda\over 16 \pi^2}\&gt; {\rm ln}(\Lambda_{\rm UV}/m_{\rm soft})
+ \ldots \right ].
\label{softy}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is schematic for various dimensionless couplings, and the ellipses stand both for terms that are independent of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> and for higher loop corrections (which depend on <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> through powers of logarithms).</p>
<p>Because the mass splittings between the known Standard Model particles and their superpartners are just determined by the parameters <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> appearing in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span>, eq. ([softy]) tells us that the superpartner masses should not be too huge.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Otherwise, we would lose our successful cure for the hierarchy problem, since the <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}^2\)</span> corrections to the Higgs scalar squared mass parameter would be unnaturally large compared to the square of the electroweak breaking scale of 174 GeV. The top and bottom squarks and the winos and bino give especially large contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_{H_u}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_{H_d}^2\)</span>, but the gluino mass and all the other squark and slepton masses also feed in indirectly, through radiative corrections to the top and bottom squark masses. Furthermore, in most viable models of supersymmetry breaking that are not unduly contrived, the superpartner masses do not differ from each other by more than about an order of magnitude. Using <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim {M_{\rm P}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \sim 1\)</span> in eq. ([softy]), one estimates that <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>, and therefore the masses of at least the lightest few superpartners, should probably not be much greater than the TeV scale, in order for the MSSM scalar potential to provide a Higgs VEV resulting in <span class="math inline">\(m_W,m_Z\)</span> = 80.4, 91.2 GeV without miraculous cancellations. While this is a fuzzy criterion, it is the best reason for the continued optimism among many theorists that supersymmetry will be discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and can be studied at a future <span class="math inline">\(e^+ e^-\)</span> linear collider with sufficiently high energy.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the hierarchy problem was <span><em>not</em></span> the historical motivation for the development of supersymmetry in the early 1970’s. The supersymmetry algebra and supersymmetric field theories were originally concocted independently in various disguises <span class="citation" data-cites="RNS">@RNS</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Volkov">@Volkov</span> bearing little resemblance to the MSSM. It is quite impressive that a theory developed for quite different reasons, including purely aesthetic ones, was later found to provide a solution for the hierarchy problem.</p>
<p>One might also wonder whether there is any good reason why all of the superpartners of the Standard Model particles should be heavy enough to have avoided discovery so far. There is. All of the particles in the MSSM that have been found so far, except the 125 GeV Higgs boson, have something in common; they would necessarily be massless in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking. In particular, the masses of the <span class="math inline">\(W^\pm, Z^0\)</span> bosons and all quarks and leptons are equal to dimensionless coupling constants times the Higgs VEV $174 $ GeV, while the photon and gluon are required to be massless by electromagnetic and QCD gauge invariance. Conversely, all of the undiscovered particles in the MSSM have exactly the opposite property; each of them can have a Lagrangian mass term in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking. For the squarks, sleptons, and Higgs scalars this follows from a general property of complex scalar fields that a mass term <span class="math inline">\(m^2 |\phi|^2\)</span> is always allowed by all gauge symmetries. For the higgsinos and gauginos, it follows from the fact that they are fermions in a real representation of the gauge group. So, from the point of view of the MSSM, the discovery of the top quark in 1995 marked a quite natural milestone; the already-discovered particles are precisely those that had to be light, based on the principle of electroweak gauge symmetry. There is a single exception: it has long been known that at least one neutral Higgs scalar boson had to be lighter than about 135 GeV if the minimal version of supersymmetry is correct, for reasons to be discussed in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]. The 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered in 2012 is presumably this particle, and the fact that it was not much heavier can be counted as a successful prediction of supersymmetry.</p>
<p>An important feature of the MSSM is that the superpartners listed in Tables [tab:chiral] and [tab:gauge] are not necessarily the mass eigenstates of the theory. This is because after electroweak symmetry breaking and supersymmetry breaking effects are included, there can be mixing between the electroweak gauginos and the higgsinos, and within the various sets of squarks and sleptons and Higgs scalars that have the same electric charge. The lone exception is the gluino, which is a color octet fermion and therefore does not have the appropriate quantum numbers to mix with any other particle. The masses and mixings of the superpartners are obviously of paramount importance to experimentalists. It is perhaps slightly less obvious that these phenomenological issues are all quite directly related to one central question that is also the focus of much of the theoretical work in supersymmetry: “How is supersymmetry broken?” The reason for this is that most of what we do not already know about the MSSM has to do with <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span>. The structure of supersymmetric Lagrangians allows little arbitrariness, as we will see in section [sec:susylagr]. In fact, all of the dimensionless couplings and all but one mass term in the supersymmetric part of the MSSM Lagrangian correspond directly to parameters in the ordinary Standard Model that have already been measured by experiment. For example, we will find out that the supersymmetric coupling of a gluino to a squark and a quark is determined by the QCD coupling constant <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_S\)</span>. In contrast, the supersymmetry-breaking part of the Lagrangian contains many unknown parameters and, apparently, a considerable amount of arbitrariness. Each of the mass splittings between Standard Model particles and their superpartners correspond to terms in the MSSM Lagrangian that are purely supersymmetry-breaking in their origin and effect. These soft supersymmetry-breaking terms can also introduce a large number of mixing angles and CP-violating phases not found in the Standard Model. Fortunately, as we will see in section [subsec:mssm.hints], there is already strong evidence that the supersymmetry-breaking terms in the MSSM are actually not arbitrary at all. Furthermore, the additional parameters will be measured and constrained as the superpartners are detected. From a theoretical perspective, the challenge is to explain all of these parameters with a predictive model for supersymmetry breaking.</p>
<p>The rest of the discussion is organized as follows. Section [sec:notations] provides a list of important notations. In section [sec:susylagr], we will learn how to construct Lagrangians for supersymmetric field theories, while section [sec:superfields] reprises the same subject, but using the more elegant superspace formalism. Soft supersymmetry-breaking couplings are described in section [sec:soft]. In section [sec:mssm], we will apply the preceding general results to the special case of the MSSM, introduce the concept of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity, and explore the importance of the structure of the soft terms. Section [sec:origins] outlines some considerations for understanding the origin of supersymmetry breaking, and the consequences of various proposals. In section [sec:MSSMspectrum], we will study the mass and mixing angle patterns of the new particles predicted by the MSSM. Their decay modes are considered in section [sec:decays], and some of the qualitative features of experimental signals for supersymmetry are reviewed in section [sec:signals]. Section [sec:variations] describes some sample variations on the standard MSSM picture. The discussion will be lacking in historical accuracy or perspective; the reader is encouraged to consult the many outstanding books <span class="citation" data-cites="WessBaggerbook">@WessBaggerbook</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Shifman:2012zz">@Shifman:2012zz</span>, review articles <span class="citation" data-cites="HaberKanereview">@HaberKanereview</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Bertolini:2013via">@Bertolini:2013via</span> and the reprint volume <span class="citation" data-cites="reprints">@reprints</span>, which contain a much more consistent guide to the original literature.</p>
<h1 id="sec:notations"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Interlude: Notations and Conventions</h1>
<p>This section specifies my notations and conventions. Four-vector indices are represented by letters from the middle of the Greek alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\mu,\nu,\rho,\dots= 0,1,2,3\)</span>. The contravariant four-vector position and momentum of a particle are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
x^\mu = (t,\, \vec{x}), \qquad\qquad p^\mu = (E,\, \vec{p}) ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> while the four-vector derivative is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_\mu = ({\partial / \partial t},\, \vec{\nabla}) .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The spacetime metric is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\eta_{\mu\nu} = 
{\mbox{diag}}({\ominus}1, {\oplus}1, {\oplus}1, {\oplus}1), \end{eqnarray}\]</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(p^2 = {\ominus}m^2\)</span> for an on-shell particle of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is overwhelmingly convenient to employ two-component Weyl spinor notation for fermions, rather than four-component Dirac or Majorana spinors. The Lagrangian of the Standard Model (and any supersymmetric extension of it) violates parity; each Dirac fermion has left-handed and right-handed parts with completely different electroweak gauge interactions. If one used four-component spinor notation instead, then there would be clumsy left- and right-handed projection operators <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
P_L = (1 - \gamma_5)/2, \qquad\qquad
P_R = (1 + \gamma_5)/2\end{eqnarray}\]</span> all over the place. The two-component Weyl fermion notation has the advantage of treating fermionic degrees of freedom with different gauge quantum numbers separately from the start, as Nature intended for us to do. But an even better reason for using two-component notation here is that in supersymmetric models the minimal building blocks of matter are chiral supermultiplets, each of which contains a single two-component Weyl fermion.</p>
<p>Because two-component fermion notation may be unfamiliar to some readers, I now specify my conventions by showing how they correspond to the four-component spinor language. A four-component Dirac fermion <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D}\)</span> with mass <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is described by the Lagrangian <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm Dirac}
\,=\,  i \overline\Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D}
-  M \overline \Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D} \Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D}\&gt; .
\label{diraclag} \end{eqnarray}\]</span> For our purposes it is convenient to use the specific representation of the 4$$4 gamma matrices given in $2$2 blocks by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma^\mu = \pmatrix{ 0 &amp; \sigma^\mu \cr
                       {\overline\sigma}^\mu &amp; 0\cr},
\qquad\qquad
\gamma_5 = \pmatrix{-1 &amp; 0\cr 0 &amp; 1\cr},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;\sigma^0 = {\overline\sigma}^0 = \pmatrix{1&amp;0\cr 0&amp;1\cr},\qquad
\,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\sigma^1 = -{\overline\sigma}^1 = \pmatrix{0&amp;1\cr 1&amp;0\cr}, 
\nonumber\\
&amp;&amp;\sigma^2 = -{\overline\sigma}^2 = \pmatrix{ 0&amp;-i\cr i&amp;0\cr},\qquad
\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\sigma^3 = -{\overline\sigma}^3 = \pmatrix{1&amp;0\cr 0&amp;-1\cr}
\&gt; .
\label{pauli}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In this representation, a four-component Dirac spinor is written in terms of 2 two-component, complex,<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> anti-commuting objects <span class="math inline">\(\xi_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\chi^\dagger)^{\dot{\alpha}} \equiv \chi^{\dagger\dot\alpha}\)</span>, with two distinct types of spinor indices <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=1,2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\alpha}=1,2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D} =
\pmatrix{\xi_\alpha\cr {\chi^{\dagger\dot{\alpha}}}\cr} .
\label{psidirac}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> It follows that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\overline\Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D}  =
\Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D}^\dagger \pmatrix{0 &amp; 1\cr 1 &amp; 0\cr} =
\pmatrix{\chi^\alpha &amp;
                           \xi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}}\cr }
\&gt; .
\label{psid}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Undotted (dotted) indices from the beginning of the Greek alphabet are used for the first (last) two components of a Dirac spinor. The field <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is called a “left-handed Weyl spinor” and <span class="math inline">\(\chi^\dagger\)</span> is a “right-handed Weyl spinor”. The names fit, because <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
P_L \Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D} = \pmatrix{\xi_\alpha \cr 0\cr},\qquad\qquad
P_R \Psi_{{\scriptscriptstyle}D} = \pmatrix{0\cr \chi^{\dagger\dot{\alpha}}\cr}
\&gt; .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The Hermitian conjugate of any left-handed Weyl spinor is a right-handed Weyl spinor: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\psi^{\dagger}_{\dot{\alpha}}
\equiv 
(\psi_\alpha)^\dagger = (\psi^\dagger)_{\dot{\alpha}}
\, ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and vice versa: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
( \psi^{\dagger\dot{\alpha}} )^\dagger =
\psi^\alpha. \end{eqnarray}\]</span> Therefore, any particular fermionic degrees of freedom can be described equally well using a left-handed Weyl spinor (with an undotted index) or by a right-handed one (with a dotted index). By convention, all names of fermion fields are chosen so that left-handed Weyl spinors do not carry daggers and right-handed Weyl spinors do carry daggers, as in eq. ([psidirac]).</p>
<p>The heights of the dotted and undotted spinor indices are important; for example, comparing eqs. ([diraclag])-([psid]), we observe that the matrices <span class="math inline">\((\sigma^\mu)_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(({\overline\sigma}^\mu)^{\dot{\alpha}\alpha}\)</span> defined by eq. ([pauli]) carry indices with the heights as indicated. The spinor indices are raised and lowered using the antisymmetric symbol <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon^{12} = -\epsilon^{21} =
\epsilon_{21} = -\epsilon_{12} = 1, \qquad\qquad \epsilon_{11} = \epsilon_{22} =
\epsilon^{11} = \epsilon^{22} = 0,
\label{eq:defepstwo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> according to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\xi_\alpha = \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}
\xi^\beta,\qquad\qquad\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
\xi^\alpha = \epsilon^{\alpha\beta}
\xi_\beta,\qquad\qquad\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
\chi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}} = \epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}
\chi^{\dagger\dot{\beta}},\qquad\qquad\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
\chi^{\dagger\dot{\alpha}} = \epsilon^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}
\chi^\dagger_{\dot{\beta}}\&gt;.\qquad{}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is consistent since <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\alpha\beta} \epsilon^{\beta\gamma} = \epsilon^{\gamma\beta}\epsilon_{\beta\alpha} = \delta_\alpha^\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}} \epsilon^{\dot{\beta}\dot{\gamma}} = \epsilon^{\dot{\gamma}\dot{\beta}}\epsilon_{\dot{\beta}\dot{\alpha}} = \delta_{\dot{\alpha}}^{\dot{\gamma}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a convention, repeated spinor indices contracted like <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{}^\alpha\hspace{0.03cm}{}_\alpha \qquad\quad \mbox{or} 
\qquad\quad 
{}_{\dot{\alpha}}\hspace{0.03cm}{}^{\dot{\alpha}}\, \end{eqnarray}\]</span> can be suppressed. In particular, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\xi\chi \equiv \xi^\alpha\chi_\alpha = \xi^\alpha \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}
\chi^\beta = -\chi^\beta \epsilon_{\alpha\beta} \xi^\alpha =
\chi^\beta \epsilon_{\beta\alpha} \xi^\alpha = \chi^\beta \xi_\beta \equiv
\chi\xi
\label{xichi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with, conveniently, no minus sign in the end. [A minus sign appeared in eq. ([xichi]) from exchanging the order of anti-commuting spinors, but it disappeared due to the antisymmetry of the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> symbol.] Likewise, <span class="math inline">\(\xi^\dagger \chi^\dagger\)</span> and $<sup></sup>$ are equivalent abbreviations for <span class="math inline">\(\chi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}} \xi^{\dagger \dot{\alpha}} = \xi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}} \chi^{\dagger \dot{\alpha}}\)</span>, and in fact this is the complex conjugate of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\chi\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\xi\chi)^* = \chi^\dagger \xi^\dagger = \xi^\dagger \chi^\dagger.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In a similar way, one can check that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\chi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \xi)^* \,=\, 
\xi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \chi \,=\, -\chi \sigma^\mu \xi^\dagger

\label{yetanotheridentity}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> stands for <span class="math inline">\(\xi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}}({\overline\sigma}^\mu)^{\dot{\alpha}\alpha} \chi_\alpha\)</span>, etc. Note that when taking the complex conjugate of a spinor bilinear, one reverses the order. The spinors here are assumed to be classical fields; for quantum fields the complex conjugation operation in these equations would be replaced by Hermitian conjugation in the Hilbert space operator sense.</p>

<p>A four-component Majorana spinor can be obtained from the Dirac spinor of eq. ([psid]) by imposing the constraint <span class="math inline">\(\chi = \xi\)</span>, so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi_{\rm M} = \pmatrix{\xi_\alpha \cr \xi^{\dagger\dot{\alpha}}\cr},
\qquad\qquad
\overline\Psi_{\rm M}
= \pmatrix{ \xi^\alpha &amp;  \xi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}} \cr}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The four-component spinor form of the Lagrangian for a Majorana fermion with mass <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

{i\over 2}\overline\Psi_{\rm M} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \Psi_{\rm M}
- {1\over 2} M \overline\Psi_{\rm M} \Psi_{\rm M}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> can therefore be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm Majorana} \,=\, 
i\xi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu\partial_\mu \xi -
{1\over 2} M(\xi\xi + \xi^\dagger\xi^\dagger)\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in the more economical two-component Weyl spinor representation. Note that even though <span class="math inline">\(\xi_\alpha\)</span> is anti-commuting, <span class="math inline">\(\xi\xi\)</span> and its complex conjugate <span class="math inline">\(\xi^\dagger\xi^\dagger\)</span> do not vanish, because of the suppressed <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> symbol, see eq. ([xichi]). Explicitly, <span class="math inline">\(\xi\xi = \epsilon^{\alpha\beta} \xi_\beta \xi_\alpha = \xi_2\xi_1 - \xi_1 \xi_2 = 2 \xi_2 \xi_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, any theory involving spin-1/2 fermions can always be written in terms of a collection of left-handed Weyl spinors <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}\,=\, i \psi^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu\psi_i
+ \ldots\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the ellipses represent possible mass terms, gauge interactions, and Yukawa interactions with scalar fields. Here the index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> runs over the appropriate gauge and flavor indices of the fermions; it is raised or lowered by Hermitian conjugation. Gauge interactions are obtained by promoting the ordinary derivative to a gauge-covariant derivative: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}\,=\, i \psi^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu\psi_i
+ \ldots\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_\mu\psi_i \,=\, \partial_\mu\psi_i {\ominus}i g_a A^a_\mu {T^a_i}^j \psi_j,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g_a\)</span> is the gauge coupling corresponding to the Hermitian Lie algebra generator matrix <span class="math inline">\(T^a\)</span> with vector field <span class="math inline">\(A^a_\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a different <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span> for the left-handed piece and for the hermitian conjugate of the right-handed piece of a Dirac fermion. Given any expression involving bilinears of four-component spinors <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi_i = \pmatrix{ \xi_i\cr\chi_i^\dagger\cr},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> labeled by a flavor or gauge-representation index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, one can translate into two-component Weyl spinor language (or vice versa) using the dictionary: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;\overline\Psi_i P_L \Psi_j = \chi_i\xi_j,\qquad\qquad\qquad
\overline\Psi_i P_R \Psi_j = \xi_i^\dagger \chi_j^\dagger,\qquad\&gt;{}\\
&amp;&amp;\overline\Psi_i \gamma^\mu P_L \Psi_j = \xi_i^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu 
\xi_j
,\qquad\qquad
\overline\Psi_i \gamma^\mu P_R \Psi_j = \chi_i \sigma^\mu \chi^\dagger_j
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> etc.</p>
<p>Let us now see how the Standard Model quarks and leptons are described in this notation. The complete list of left-handed Weyl spinors can be given names corresponding to the chiral supermultiplets in Table [tab:chiral]: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
Q_i &amp; = &amp;
\pmatrix{u\cr d},\&gt;\, 
\pmatrix{c\cr s},\&gt;\, 
\pmatrix{t\cr b},

\&gt;\&gt;{\overline}u ,\&gt;\,{\overline}c,\&gt;\, {\overline}t,
\\
{\overline}d_i &amp; = &amp;
\&gt;\&gt;{\overline}d ,\&gt;\,{\overline}s,\&gt;\, {\overline}b

\pmatrix{\nu_\tau\cr \tau},\&gt;\, 
\\
{\overline}e_i &amp; = &amp;
\&gt;\&gt;{\overline}e ,\&gt;\,{\overline}\mu,\&gt;\, {\overline}\tau    .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2,3\)</span> is a family index. The bars on these fields are part of the names of the fields, and do <span><em>not</em></span> denote any kind of conjugation. Rather, the unbarred fields are the left-handed pieces of a Dirac spinor, while the barred fields are the names given to the conjugates of the right-handed piece of a Dirac spinor. For example, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the same thing as <span class="math inline">\(e_L\)</span> in Table [tab:chiral], and <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(e_R^\dagger\)</span>. Together they form a Dirac spinor: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\pmatrix{e\cr {{\overline}e}^\dagger} \equiv \pmatrix{e_L \cr e_R} ,
\label{espinor}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and similarly for all of the other quark and charged lepton Dirac spinors. (The neutrinos of the Standard Model are not part of a Dirac spinor, at least in the approximation that they are massless.) The fields <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span> are weak isodoublets, which always go together when one is constructing interactions invariant under the full Standard Model gauge group <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span>. Suppressing all color and weak isospin indices, the kinetic and gauge part of the Standard Model fermion Lagrangian density is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}\,=\,
 iQ^{\dagger i}{\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu Q_i
+ i{\overline}u^{\dagger }_i{\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu {\overline}u^i
+ i{\overline}d^{\dagger }_i{\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu {\overline}d^i
+ i L^{\dagger i}{\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu L_i
+ i {\overline}e^{\dagger }_i{\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu {\overline}e^i
\qquad{}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with the family index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> summed over, and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_\mu\)</span> the appropriate Standard Model covariant derivative. For example, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_\mu \pmatrix{ \nu_e \cr e} &amp;=&amp;
\left [ \partial_\mu {\ominus}i g W^a_\mu (\tau^a/2)

\pmatrix{ \nu_e \cr e}
\\
\nabla_\mu \overline e &amp;=&amp; \left [ \partial_\mu 
{\ominus}i g&#39; Y_{{\overline}e} B_\mu \right ] {\overline}e\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\tau^a\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(a=1,2,3\)</span>) equal to the Pauli matrices, <span class="math inline">\(Y_L = -1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{{\overline}e} = +1\)</span>. The gauge eigenstate weak bosons are related to the mass eigenstates by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^\pm_\mu &amp;=&amp; (W_\mu^1 \mp i W_\mu^2)/\sqrt{2} ,
\\
\pmatrix{Z_\mu \cr A_\mu} &amp;=&amp; 
\pmatrix{\cos\theta_W &amp; - \sin\theta_W \cr
         \sin\theta_W &amp; \cos\theta_W \cr }
\pmatrix{W^3_\mu \cr B_\mu} .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Similar expressions hold for the other quark and lepton gauge eigenstates, with <span class="math inline">\(Y_Q = 1/6\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_{{\overline}u} = -2/3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{{\overline}d} = 1/3\)</span>. The quarks also have a term in the covariant derivative corresponding to gluon interactions proportional to <span class="math inline">\(g_3\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_S = g_3^2/4 \pi\)</span>) with generators <span class="math inline">\(T^a = \lambda^a/2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, and in the complex conjugate representation <span class="math inline">\(T^a = -(\lambda^a)^*/2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> are the Gell-Mann matrices.</p>

<h1 id="sec:susylagr"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Supersymmetric Lagrangians</h1>
<p>In this section we will describe the construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians. The goal is a recipe that will allow us to write down the allowed interactions and mass terms of a general supersymmetric theory, so that later we can apply the results to the special case of the MSSM. In this section, we will not use the superfield <span class="citation" data-cites="superfields">@superfields</span> language, which is more elegant and efficient for many purposes, but requires a more specialized machinery and might seem rather cabalistic at first. Section [sec:superfields] will provide the superfield version of the same material. We begin by considering the simplest example of a supersymmetric theory in four dimensions.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:susylagr.freeWZ"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The simplest supersymmetric model: a free chiral supermultiplet</h2>
<p>The minimum fermion content of a field theory in four dimensions consists of a single left-handed two-component Weyl fermion <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>. Since this is an intrinsically complex object, it seems sensible to choose as its superpartner a complex scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>. The simplest action we can write down for these fields just consists of kinetic energy terms for each: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;S = \int d^4x\&gt;
\left ({{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion}\right ) ,
\label{Lwz} \\
&amp;&amp;{{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar} = 
  {\ominus}\partial^\mu \phi^* \partial_\mu \phi ,
\qquad\qquad
{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion} = 
  i \psi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is called the massless, non-interacting <span><em>Wess-Zumino model</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="WessZumino">@WessZumino</span>, and it corresponds to a single chiral supermultiplet as discussed in the Introduction.</p>
<p>A supersymmetry transformation should turn the scalar boson field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> into something involving the fermion field <span class="math inline">\(\psi_\alpha\)</span>. The simplest possibility for the transformation of the scalar field is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}\phi = \epsilon \psi,\qquad\qquad
{\delta}\phi^* = \epsilon^\dagger \psi^\dagger ,
\label{phitrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^\alpha\)</span> is an infinitesimal, anti-commuting, two-component Weyl fermion object that parameterizes the supersymmetry transformation. Until section [subsec:origins.gravitino], we will be discussing global supersymmetry, which means that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^\alpha\)</span> is a constant, satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu \epsilon^\alpha=0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> has dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^{3/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> has dimensions of [mass], it must be that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> has dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^{-1/2}\)</span>. Using eq. ([phitrans]), we find that the scalar part of the Lagrangian transforms as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar} \,=\, 
{\ominus}\epsilon \partial^\mu \psi \&gt; \partial_\mu \phi^*
{\ominus}\epsilon^\dagger \partial^\mu \psi^\dagger \&gt; \partial_\mu \phi .
\label{Lphitrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> We would like for this to be canceled by <span class="math inline">\({\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion}\)</span>, at least up to a total derivative, so that the action will be invariant under the supersymmetry transformation. Comparing eq. ([Lphitrans]) with <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion}\)</span>, we see that for this to have any chance of happening, <span class="math inline">\({\delta}\psi\)</span> should be linear in <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^\dagger\)</span> and in <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, and should contain one spacetime derivative. Up to a multiplicative constant, there is only one possibility to try: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}\psi_\alpha
\,=\,
- i (\sigma^\mu \epsilon^\dagger)_\alpha\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi,
\qquad\qquad
{\delta}\psi^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}}
\,=\,
 i (\epsilon\sigma^\mu)_{\dot{\alpha}}\&gt;   \partial_\mu \phi^* .
\label{psitrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> With this guess, one immediately obtains <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion} =
-\epsilon \sigma^\mu {\overline\sigma}^\nu \partial_\nu \psi\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi^*
+\psi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\nu \sigma^\mu \epsilon^\dagger \&gt;
\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \phi
\&gt; .
\label{preLpsitrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This can be simplified by employing the Pauli matrix identities eqs. ([pauliidentA]), ([pauliidentB]) and using the fact that partial derivatives commute <span class="math inline">\((\partial_\mu\partial_\nu = \partial_\nu\partial_\mu)\)</span>. Equation ([preLpsitrans]) then becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion} &amp; = &amp;
{\oplus}\epsilon\partial^\mu\psi\&gt; \partial_\mu\phi^*
{\oplus}\epsilon^\dagger \partial^\mu\psi^\dagger\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi
\nonumber\\ &amp;&amp; 
- \partial_\mu \left (
\epsilon \sigma^\nu {\overline\sigma}^\mu \psi \&gt; \partial_\nu \phi^* 
{\oplus}\epsilon \psi\&gt; \partial^\mu \phi^*
{\oplus}\epsilon^\dagger \psi^\dagger \&gt; \partial^\mu \phi \right ).
\label{Lpsitrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first two terms here just cancel against <span class="math inline">\({\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar}\)</span>, while the remaining contribution is a total derivative. So we arrive at <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}S =
\int d^4x \&gt;\&gt;\, ({\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar} + {\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion})
= 0,\&gt;
\label{invar}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> justifying our guess of the numerical multiplicative factor made in eq. ([psitrans]).</p>
<p>We are not quite finished in showing that the theory described by eq. ([Lwz]) is supersymmetric. We must also show that the supersymmetry algebra closes; in other words, that the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations parameterized by two different spinors <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_2\)</span> is another symmetry of the theory. Using eq. ([psitrans]) in eq. ([phitrans]), one finds <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\delta_{\epsilon_2} \delta_{\epsilon_1} -
\delta_{\epsilon_1} \delta_{\epsilon_2}) \phi 
\,\equiv\,
\delta_{\epsilon_2} (\delta_{\epsilon_1} \phi) -
\delta_{\epsilon_1} (\delta_{\epsilon_2} \phi) 
\,=\,
i (- \epsilon_1 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_2^\dagger 
   + \epsilon_2 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_1^\dagger)\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi
. \label{coophi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is a remarkable result; in words, we have found that the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations gives us back the derivative of the original field. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics <span class="math inline">\({\ominus}i\partial_\mu\)</span> corresponds to the generator of spacetime translations <span class="math inline">\(P_\mu\)</span>, so eq. ([coophi]) implies the form of the supersymmetry algebra that was foreshadowed in eq. ([susyalgone]) of the Introduction. (We will make this statement more explicit before the end of this section, and prove it again a different way in section [sec:superfields].)</p>
<p>All of this will be for nothing if we do not find the same result for the fermion <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>. Using eq. ([phitrans]) in eq. ([psitrans]), we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\delta_{\epsilon_2} \delta_{\epsilon_1} -
\delta_{\epsilon_1} \delta_{\epsilon_2}) \psi_\alpha 
\,=\,
-i(\sigma^\mu\epsilon_1^\dagger)_\alpha\&gt;  \epsilon_2 \partial_\mu\psi  
+i(\sigma^\mu\epsilon_2^\dagger)_\alpha \&gt; \epsilon_1 \partial_\mu\psi
{}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This can be put into a more useful form by applying the Fierz identity eq. ([fierce]) with <span class="math inline">\(\chi = \sigma^\mu \epsilon_1^\dagger\)</span>, $= <em>{2} $, <span class="math inline">\(\eta = \partial_\mu \psi\)</span>, and again with <span class="math inline">\(\chi = \sigma^\mu \epsilon_2^\dagger\)</span>, $= </em>{1} $, <span class="math inline">\(\eta = \partial_\mu \psi\)</span>, followed in each case by an application of the identity eq. ([yetanotheridentity]). The result is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\delta_{\epsilon_2} \delta_{\epsilon_1} -
\delta_{\epsilon_1} \delta_{\epsilon_2}) \psi_\alpha 
&amp; = &amp;
 i (-\epsilon_1 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_2^\dagger 
    +\epsilon_2 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_1^\dagger) \&gt; \partial_\mu \psi_\alpha
+ i \epsilon_{1\alpha} \&gt; \epsilon_2^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu\psi
- i \epsilon_{2\alpha} \&gt; \epsilon_1^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu 
\partial_\mu\psi
{}.\phantom{xxxxx}
\label{commpsi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The last two terms in ([commpsi]) vanish on-shell; that is, if the equation of motion <span class="math inline">\({\overline\sigma}^\mu\partial_\mu \psi = 0\)</span> following from the action is enforced. The remaining piece is exactly the same spacetime translation that we found for the scalar field.</p>
<p>The fact that the supersymmetry algebra only closes on-shell (when the classical equations of motion are satisfied) might be somewhat worrisome, since we would like the symmetry to hold even quantum mechanically. This can be fixed by a trick. We invent a new complex scalar field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, which does not have a kinetic term. Such fields are called <span><em>auxiliary</em></span>, and they are really just book-keeping devices that allow the symmetry algebra to close off-shell. The Lagrangian density for <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and its complex conjugate is simply <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm auxiliary} = F^* F \&gt; .
\label{lagraux}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, unlike an ordinary scalar field, which has dimensions of [mass]. Equation ([lagraux]) implies the not-very-exciting equations of motion <span class="math inline">\(F=F^*=0\)</span>. However, we can use the auxiliary fields to our advantage by including them in the supersymmetry transformation rules. In view of eq. ([commpsi]), a plausible thing to do is to make <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> transform into a multiple of the equation of motion for <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\delta}F = - i \epsilon^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi,
\qquad\qquad
{\delta}F^* = i\partial_\mu \psi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \epsilon .
\label{Ftrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Once again we have chosen the overall factor on the right-hand sides by virtue of foresight. Now the auxiliary part of the Lagrangian density transforms as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta {{\cal L}}_{\rm auxiliary} = 
-i \epsilon^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi \&gt; F^* 
+i \partial_\mu \psi^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \epsilon \&gt; F ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which vanishes on-shell, but not for arbitrary off-shell field configurations. Now, by adding an extra term to the transformation law for <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi^\dagger\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta \psi_\alpha =
- i (\sigma^\mu \epsilon^\dagger)_{\alpha}\&gt; \partial_\mu\phi 
+ \epsilon_\alpha F,
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;
\delta \psi_{\dot{\alpha}}^\dagger =
i (\epsilon\sigma^\mu)_{\dot{\alpha}}\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi^* 
+ \epsilon^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}} F^* ,
\label{fermiontrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> one obtains an additional contribution to <span class="math inline">\({\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion}\)</span>, which just cancels with <span class="math inline">\({\delta}{{\cal L}}_{\rm auxiliary}\)</span>, up to a total derivative term. So our “modified” theory with <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}= {{\cal L}}_{\rm scalar} +{{\cal L}}_{\rm fermion} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm auxiliary}\)</span> is still invariant under supersymmetry transformations. Proceeding as before, one now obtains for each of the fields <span class="math inline">\(X=\phi,\phi^*,\psi,\psi^\dagger,F,F^*\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\delta_{\epsilon_2} \delta_{\epsilon_1} -
\delta_{\epsilon_1} \delta_{\epsilon_2}) X &amp;=&amp;
i (-\epsilon_1 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_2^\dagger +
   \epsilon_2 \sigma^\mu \epsilon_1^\dagger) \&gt; \partial_\mu X
\label{anytrans}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> using eqs. ([phitrans]), ([Ftrans]), and ([fermiontrans]), but now without resorting to any equations of motion. So we have succeeded in showing that supersymmetry is a valid symmetry of the Lagrangian off-shell.</p>
<p>In retrospect, one can see why we needed to introduce the auxiliary field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in order to get the supersymmetry algebra to work off-shell. On-shell, the complex scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> has two real propagating degrees of freedom, matching the two spin polarization states of <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>. Off-shell, however, the Weyl fermion <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is a complex two-component object, so it has four real degrees of freedom. (Going on-shell eliminates half of the propagating degrees of freedom for <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, because the Lagrangian is linear in time derivatives, so that the canonical momenta can be re-expressed in terms of the configuration variables without time derivatives and are not independent phase space coordinates.) To make the numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom match off-shell as well as on-shell, we had to introduce two more real scalar degrees of freedom in the complex field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, which are eliminated when one goes on-shell. This counting is summarized in Table [table:WZdofcounting]. The auxiliary field formulation is especially useful when discussing spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, as we will see in section [sec:origins].</p>

<p>Invariance of the action under a continuous symmetry transformation always implies the existence of a conserved current, and supersymmetry is no exception. The <span><em>supercurrent</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(J^\mu_\alpha\)</span> is an anti-commuting four-vector. It also carries a spinor index, as befits the current associated with a symmetry with fermionic generators <span class="citation" data-cites="ref:supercurrent">@ref:supercurrent</span>.

This demonstration of the supersymmetry algebra in terms of the canonical generators <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger\)</span> requires the use of the Hamiltonian equations of motion, but the symmetry itself is valid off-shell at the level of the Lagrangian, as we have already shown.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:susylagr.chiral"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Interactions of chiral supermultiplets</h2>
<p>In a realistic theory like the MSSM, there are many chiral supermultiplets, with both gauge and non-gauge interactions. In this subsection, our task is to construct the most general possible theory of masses and non-gauge interactions for particles that live in chiral supermultiplets. In the MSSM these are the quarks, squarks, leptons, sleptons, Higgs scalars and higgsino fermions. We will find that the form of the non-gauge couplings, including mass terms, is highly restricted by the requirement that the action is invariant under supersymmetry transformations. (Gauge interactions will be dealt with in the following subsections.)</p>
<p>Our starting point is the Lagrangian density for a collection of free chiral supermultiplets labeled by an index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, which runs over all gauge and flavor degrees of freedom. Since we will want to construct an interacting theory with supersymmetry closing off-shell, each supermultiplet contains a complex scalar <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> and a left-handed Weyl fermion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span> as physical degrees of freedom, plus a non-propagating complex auxiliary field <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>. The results of the previous subsection tell us that the free part of the Lagrangian is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm free} &amp;=&amp;
{\ominus}\partial^\mu \phi^{*i} \partial_\mu \phi_i
+ i {\psi}^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i
+ F^{*i} F_i ,
\label{lagrfree}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where we sum over repeated indices <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (not to be confused with the suppressed spinor indices), with the convention that fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span> always carry lowered indices, while their conjugates always carry raised indices. It is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:Ftran}\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>We will now find the most general set of renormalizable interactions for these fields that is consistent with supersymmetry. We do this working in the field theory before integrating out the auxiliary fields. To begin, note that in order to be renormalizable by power counting, each term must have field content with total mass dimension <span class="math inline">\(\leq 4\)</span>. So, the only candidate terms are: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm int} =
\left (-{1\over 2} W^{ij} \psi_i \psi_j + W^i F_i + x^{ij} F_i F_j \right ) 
+ {{{\rm c.c.}}}- U,
\label{pretryint}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W^i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^{ij}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> are polynomials in the scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i, \phi^{*i}\)</span>, with degrees <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, respectively. [Terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i} F_j\)</span> are already included in eq. ([lagrfree]), with the coefficient fixed by the transformation rules ([phitran])-([eq:Ftran]).]</p>
<p>We must now require that <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations, since <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm free}\)</span> was already invariant by itself. This immediately requires that the candidate term <span class="math inline">\(U(\phi_i, \phi^{*i})\)</span> must vanish. If there were such a term, then under a supersymmetry transformation eq. ([phitran]) it would transform into another function of the scalar fields only, multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\psi_i\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\epsilon^\dagger}{\psi}^{\dagger i}\)</span>, and with no spacetime derivatives or <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i}\)</span> fields. It is easy to see from eqs. ([phitran])-([pretryint]) that nothing of this form can possibly be canceled by the supersymmetry transformation of any other term in the Lagrangian. Similarly, the dimensionless coupling <span class="math inline">\(x^{ij}\)</span> must be zero, because its supersymmetry transformation likewise cannot possibly be canceled by any other term. So, we are left with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm int} =
\left (-{{1\over 2}}W^{ij} \psi_i \psi_j + W^i F_i \right ) + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\label{tryint}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> as the only possibilities. At this point, we are not assuming that <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W^i\)</span> are related to each other in any way. However, soon we will find out that they <span><em>are</em></span> related, which is why we have chosen to use the same letter for them. Notice that eq. ([xichi]) tells us that <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span> is symmetric under <span class="math inline">\(i\leftrightarrow j\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is easiest to divide the variation of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> into several parts, which must cancel separately. First, we consider the part that contains four spinors: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta {{\cal L}}_{\rm int} |_{\rm 4-spinor} = \left [
-{1\over 2} {\delta W^{ij} \over \delta \phi_k} 
  (\epsilon \psi_k)(\psi_i \psi_j)
-{1\over 2} {\delta W^{ij} \over \delta \phi^{*k}}
  ({\epsilon^\dagger}{\psi}^{\dagger k})(\psi_i \psi_j) \right ]
+ {{{\rm c.c.}}}\label{deltafourferm}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The term proportional to <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon \psi_k)(\psi_i\psi_j)\)</span> cannot cancel against any other term. Fortunately, however, the Fierz identity eq. ([fierce]) implies <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\epsilon \psi_i) (\psi_j \psi_k) + (\epsilon \psi_j) (\psi_k \psi_i)
+ (\epsilon \psi_k) (\psi_i\psi_j) = 0 ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so this contribution to <span class="math inline">\(\delta{{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> vanishes identically if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\delta W^{ij}/\delta \phi_k\)</span> is totally symmetric under interchange of <span class="math inline">\(i,j,k\)</span>. There is no such identity available for the term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(({\epsilon^\dagger } {\psi}^{\dagger k})(\psi_i\psi_j)\)</span>. Since that term cannot cancel with any other, requiring it to be absent just tells us that <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span> cannot contain <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{*k}\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span> is holomorphic (or complex analytic) in the complex fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Combining what we have learned so far, we can write <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^{ij} = M^{ij} + y^{ijk} \phi_k\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span> is a symmetric mass matrix for the fermion fields, and <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span> is a Yukawa coupling of a scalar <span class="math inline">\(\phi_k\)</span> and two fermions <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i \psi_j\)</span> that must be totally symmetric under interchange of <span class="math inline">\(i,j,k\)</span>. It is therefore possible, and it turns out to be convenient, to write <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^{ij} = {\delta^2 \over \delta\phi_i\delta\phi_j} W
\label{expresswij}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where we have introduced a useful object <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W =
{1\over 2} M^{ij} \phi_i \phi_j + {1\over 6} y^{ijk} \phi_i \phi_j \phi_k,
\label{superpotential}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> called the <span><em>superpotential</em></span>. This is not a scalar potential in the ordinary sense; in fact, it is not even real. It is instead a holomorphic function of the scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> treated as complex variables.</p>
<p>Continuing on our vaunted quest, we next consider the parts of <span class="math inline">\(\delta {{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> that contain a spacetime derivative: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta {{\cal L}}_{\rm int} |_\partial &amp;=&amp; \left (
 i W^{ij}\partial_\mu \phi_j \, \psi_i \sigma^\mu {\epsilon^\dagger}
+ i W^i\, \partial_\mu \psi_i\sigma^\mu {\epsilon^\dagger}
\right ) +{{{\rm c.c.}}}\label{wijwi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here we have used the identity eq. ([yetanotheridentity]) on the second term, which came from <span class="math inline">\((\delta F_i)W^i\)</span>. Now we can use eq. ([expresswij]) to observe that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^{ij} \partial_\mu \phi_j =
\partial_\mu \left ( {\delta W\over \delta{\phi_i}}\right ) .
\label{parttwo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Therefore, eq. ([wijwi]) will be a total derivative if <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^i = {\delta W\over \delta \phi_i} 
= M^{ij}\phi_j + {1\over 2} y^{ijk} \phi_j \phi_k\&gt; ,
\label{wiwiwi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which explains why we chose its name as we did. The remaining terms in <span class="math inline">\(\delta {{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> are all linear in <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i}\)</span>, and it is easy to show that they cancel, given the results for <span class="math inline">\(W^i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W^{ij}\)</span> that we have already found.</p>
<p>Actually, we can include a linear term in the superpotential without disturbing the validity of the previous discussion at all: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W = L^i \phi_i +
{1\over 2} M^{ij} \phi_i \phi_j + {1\over 6} y^{ijk} \phi_i \phi_j \phi_k
.
\label{superpotentialwithlinear}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(L^i\)</span> are parameters with dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, which affect only the scalar potential part of the Lagrangian. Such linear terms are only allowed when <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> is a gauge singlet, and there are no such gauge singlet chiral supermultiplets in the MSSM with minimal field content. I will therefore omit this term from the remaining discussion of this section. However, this type of term does play an important role in the discussion of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, as we will see in section [subsec:origins.general].</p>
<p>To recap, we have found that the most general non-gauge interactions for chiral supermultiplets are determined by a single holomorphic function of the complex scalar fields, the superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. The auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i}\)</span> can be eliminated using their classical equations of motion. The part of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm free} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span> that contains the auxiliary fields is $ F_i F^{<em>i} + W^i F_{i} + W^{</em>}_i F^{*i}$, leading to the equations of motion <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
F_i = -W_i^*,\qquad\qquad F^{*i} = -W^i \&gt; .
\label{replaceF}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus the auxiliary fields are expressible algebraically (without any derivatives) in terms of the scalar fields.</p>
<p>After making the replacement<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> eq. ([replaceF]) in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm free} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm int}\)</span>, we obtain the Lagrangian density <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}= {\ominus}\partial^\mu \phi^{*i} \partial_\mu \phi_i
+ i \psi^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i
-{{1\over 2}}\left (W^{ij} \psi_i \psi_j  + W^{*}_{ij} \psi^{\dagger i}
\psi^{\dagger j} \right )
- W^i W^{*}_i.
\label{noFlagr}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now that the non-propagating fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i, F^{*i}\)</span> have been eliminated, it follows from eq. ([noFlagr]) that the scalar potential for the theory is just given in terms of the superpotential by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V(\phi,\phi^*) = W^k W_k^* = F^{*k} F_k = 
\phantom{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.}
&amp;&amp;
\nonumber
\\ 
M^*_{ik} M^{kj} \phi^{*i} \phi_{j}

+{1\over 2} M_{in}^{*} y^{jkn} \phi^{*i} \phi_j \phi_k
+{1\over 4} y^{ijn} y_{kln}^{*} \phi_i \phi_j \phi^{*k} \phi^{*l}
\, .
&amp;&amp;
\label{ordpot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This scalar potential is automatically bounded from below; in fact, since it is a sum of squares of absolute values (of the <span class="math inline">\(W^k\)</span>), it is always non-negative. If we substitute the general form for the superpotential eq. ([superpotential]) into eq. ([noFlagr]), we obtain for the full Lagrangian density <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}&amp;=&amp;
{\ominus}\partial^\mu \phi^{*i} \partial_\mu \phi_i - V(\phi,\phi^*)
+ i \psi^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i
- {{1\over 2}}M^{ij} \psi_i\psi_j - {{1\over 2}}M_{ij}^{*} \psi^{\dagger i}
\psi^{\dagger j}
\nonumber\\
&amp;&amp; - {{1\over 2}}y^{ijk} \phi_i \psi_j \psi_k - {{1\over 2}}y_{ijk}^{*} \phi^{*i}
\psi^{\dagger j} \psi^{\dagger k}.
\label{lagrchiral}\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can compare the masses of the fermions and scalars by looking at the linearized equations of motion: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\partial^\mu\partial_\mu \phi_i &amp;=&amp; 
{\oplus}M_{ik}^{*} M^{kj} \phi_j
+ \ldots,\\
i{\overline\sigma}^\mu\partial_\mu\psi_i &amp;=&amp;  
M_{ij}^{*} \psi^{\dagger j}+\ldots,
\qquad\qquad
i\sigma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi^{\dagger i} \&gt;=\&gt; 
M^{ij} \psi_j +\ldots .\qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{linfermiontwo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> One can eliminate <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\psi^\dagger\)</span> and vice versa in eq. ([linfermiontwo]), obtaining [after use of the identities eqs. ([pauliidentA]) and ([pauliidentB])]: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\partial^\mu\partial_\mu \psi_i =   
{\oplus}M_{ik}^{*} M^{kj} \psi_j
+ \ldots ,\qquad\qquad
\partial^\mu\partial_\mu \psi^{\dagger j} =
{\oplus}\psi^{\dagger i} M_{ik}^{*} M^{kj}+\ldots
\&gt; .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Therefore, the fermions and the bosons satisfy the same wave equation with exactly the same squared-mass matrix with real non-negative eigenvalues, namely <span class="math inline">\({(M^2)_i}^j = M_{ik}^{*} M^{kj}\)</span>. It follows that diagonalizing this matrix by redefining the fields with a unitary matrix gives a collection of chiral supermultiplets, each of which contains a mass-degenerate complex scalar and Weyl fermion, in agreement with the general argument in the Introduction.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:susylagr.gauge"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Lagrangians for gauge supermultiplets</h2>
<p>The propagating degrees of freedom in a gauge supermultiplet are a massless gauge boson field <span class="math inline">\(A_\mu^a\)</span> and a two-component Weyl fermion gaugino <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span>. The index <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> here runs over the adjoint representation of the gauge group (<span class="math inline">\(a=1,\ldots ,8\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> color gluons and gluinos; <span class="math inline">\(a=1,2,3\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> weak isospin; <span class="math inline">\(a=1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> weak hypercharge). The gauge transformations of the vector supermultiplet fields are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
A^a_\mu &amp;\rightarrow&amp;  A^a_\mu
{\oplus}\partial_\mu \Lambda^a + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu \Lambda^c ,
\label{Agaugetr}
\\
\lambda^a &amp;\rightarrow&amp; \lambda^a + g f^{abc} \lambda^b \Lambda^c
,
\label{lamgaugetr}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda^a\)</span> is an infinitesimal gauge transformation parameter, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the gauge coupling, and <span class="math inline">\(f^{abc}\)</span> are the totally antisymmetric structure constants that define the gauge group. The special case of an Abelian group is obtained by just setting <span class="math inline">\(f^{abc}=0\)</span>; the corresponding gaugino is a gauge singlet in that case. The conventions are such that for QED, <span class="math inline">\(A^\mu = (V, \vec{A})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> are the usual electric potential and vector potential, with electric and magnetic fields given by <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla} V - \partial_0 \vec{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The on-shell degrees of freedom for <span class="math inline">\(A^a_\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a_\alpha\)</span> amount to two bosonic and two fermionic helicity states (for each <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>), as required by supersymmetry. However, off-shell <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a_\alpha\)</span> consists of two complex, or four real, fermionic degrees of freedom, while <span class="math inline">\(A^a_\mu\)</span> only has three real bosonic degrees of freedom; one degree of freedom is removed by the inhomogeneous gauge transformation eq. ([Agaugetr]). So, we will need one real bosonic auxiliary field, traditionally called <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span>, in order for supersymmetry to be consistent off-shell. This field also transforms as an adjoint of the gauge group [i.e., like eq. ([lamgaugetr]) with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> replaced by <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span>] and satisfies <span class="math inline">\((D^a)^* = D^a\)</span>. Like the chiral auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>, the gauge auxiliary field <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> has dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> and no kinetic term, so it can be eliminated on-shell using its algebraic equation of motion. The counting of degrees of freedom is summarized in Table [table:gaugedofcounting].</p>

<p>Therefore, the Lagrangian density for a gauge supermultiplet ought to be <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

To check that eq. ([lagrgauge]) is really supersymmetric, one must specify the supersymmetry transformations of the fields. The forms of these follow from the requirements that they should be linear in the infinitesimal parameters <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon,\epsilon^\dagger\)</span> with dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^{-1/2}\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(\delta A^a_\mu\)</span> is real, and that <span class="math inline">\(\delta D^a\)</span> should be real and proportional to the field equations for the gaugino, in analogy with the role of the auxiliary field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in the chiral supermultiplet case. Thus one can guess, up to multiplicative factors, that<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp; \delta A_\mu^a =

\label{Dtransf}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The factors of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> are chosen so that the action obtained by integrating <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm gauge}\)</span> is indeed invariant, and the phase of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> is chosen for future convenience in treating the MSSM.</p>
<p>It is now a little bit tedious, but straightforward, to also check that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\delta_{\epsilon_2} \delta_{\epsilon_1} -\delta_{\epsilon_1}

This ensures that the supersymmetry algebra eqs. ([nonschsusyalg1])-([nonschsusyalg2]) is realized on gauge-invariant combinations of fields in gauge supermultiplets, as they were on the chiral supermultiplets [compare eq. ([anytrans])]. This check requires the use of identities eqs. ([eq:dei]), ([eq:feif]) and ([eq:lloydhouserules]). If we had not included the auxiliary field <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span>, then the supersymmetry algebra eq. ([joeyramone]) would hold only after using the equations of motion for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\dagger a}\)</span>. The auxiliary fields satisfies a trivial equation of motion <span class="math inline">\(D^a=0\)</span>, but this is modified if one couples the gauge supermultiplets to chiral supermultiplets, as we now do.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Supersymmetric gauge interactions</h2>
<p>Now we are ready to consider a general Lagrangian density for a supersymmetric theory with both chiral and gauge supermultiplets. Suppose that the chiral supermultiplets transform under the gauge group in a representation with hermitian matrices <span class="math inline">\({(T^a)_i}^j\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\([T^a,T^b] =i f^{abc} T^c\)</span>. [For example, if the gauge group is <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f^{abc} = \epsilon^{abc}\)</span>, and for a chiral supermultiplet transforming in the fundamental representation the <span class="math inline">\(T^a\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> times the Pauli matrices.] Because supersymmetry and gauge transformations commute, the scalar, fermion, and auxiliary fields must be in the same representation of the gauge group, so <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
X_i &amp;\rightarrow&amp; X_i + ig \Lambda^a (T^a X)_i\end{eqnarray}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(X_i = \phi_i,\psi_i,F_i\)</span>. To have a gauge-invariant Lagrangian, we now need to replace the ordinary derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu \phi_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu \phi^{*i}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu \psi_i\)</span> in eq. ([lagrfree]) with covariant derivatives: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_\mu \phi_i &amp;=&amp; \partial_\mu \phi_i {\ominus}i g A^a_\mu (T^a\phi)_i
\label{ordtocovphi}
\\
\nabla_\mu \phi^{*i} &amp;=&amp; \partial_\mu \phi^{*i} {\oplus}i g A^a_\mu (\phi^* T^a)^i
\\
\nabla_\mu \psi_i &amp;=&amp; \partial_\mu \psi_i {\ominus}i g A^a_\mu (T^a\psi)_i .
\label{ordtocovpsi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Naively, this simple procedure achieves the goal of coupling the vector bosons in the gauge supermultiplet to the scalars and fermions in the chiral supermultiplets. However, we also have to consider whether there are any other interactions allowed by gauge invariance and involving the gaugino and <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> fields, which might have to be included to make a supersymmetric Lagrangian. Since <span class="math inline">\(A^a_\mu\)</span> couples to <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span>, it makes sense that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> should as well.</p>
<p>In fact, there are three such possible interaction terms that are renormalizable (of field mass dimension <span class="math inline">\(\leq 4\)</span>), namely <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
(\phi^* T^a \psi)\lambda^a,\qquad
\lambda^{\dagger a} (\psi^\dagger T^a
\phi),
\qquad {\rm and} \qquad
(\phi^* T^a \phi) D^a .
\label{extrater}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now one can add them, with unknown dimensionless coupling coefficients, to the Lagrangians for the chiral and gauge supermultiplets, and demand that the whole mess be real and invariant under supersymmetry, up to a total derivative. Not surprisingly, this is possible only if the supersymmetry transformation laws for the matter fields are modified to include gauge-covariant rather than ordinary derivatives. Also, it is necessary to include one strategically chosen extra term in <span class="math inline">\(\delta F_i\)</span>, so: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;
\delta \phi_i = \epsilon\psi_i
\label{gphitran}\\
&amp;&amp;\delta \psi_{i\alpha} =
-i (\sigma^\mu \epsilon^\dagger)_{\alpha}\&gt; \nabla_\mu\phi_i + \epsilon_\alpha F_i
\\
&amp;&amp;{\delta}F_i = -i \epsilon^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \nabla_\mu \psi_i
\&gt; + \&gt; \sqrt{2} g (T^a \phi)_i\&gt; \epsilon^\dagger \lambda^{\dagger a} .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> After some algebra one can now fix the coefficients for the terms in eq. ([extrater]), with the result that the full Lagrangian density for a renormalizable supersymmetric theory is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}&amp; = &amp; {{\cal L}}_{\rm chiral} + {{\cal L}}_{\rm gauge} 
\nonumber\\
        &amp;&amp; - \sqrt{2} g 
(\phi^* T^a \psi)\lambda^a 
- \sqrt{2} g\lambda^{\dagger a} (\psi^\dagger T^a \phi)
+ g  (\phi^* T^a \phi) D^a .
\label{gensusylagr}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm chiral }\)</span> means the chiral supermultiplet Lagrangian found in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral] [e.g., eq. ([noFlagr]) or ([lagrchiral])], but with ordinary derivatives replaced everywhere by gauge-covariant derivatives, and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm gauge}\)</span> was given in eq. ([lagrgauge]). To prove that eq. ([gensusylagr]) is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations, one must use the identity <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^i (T^a \phi)_i = 0.
\label{wgaugeinvar}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is precisely the condition that must be satisfied anyway in order for the superpotential, and thus <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm chiral}\)</span>, to be gauge invariant.</p>
<p>The second line in eq. ([gensusylagr]) consists of interactions whose strengths are fixed to be gauge couplings by the requirements of supersymmetry, even though they are not gauge interactions from the point of view of an ordinary field theory. The first two terms are a direct coupling of gauginos to matter fields; this can be thought of as the “supersymmetrization” of the usual gauge boson couplings to matter fields. The last term combines with the <span class="math inline">\(D^a D^a/2\)</span> term in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm gauge}\)</span> to provide an equation of motion <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
D^a = -g (\phi^* T^a \phi ).
\label{solveforD}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus, like the auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> are expressible purely algebraically in terms of the scalar fields. Replacing the auxiliary fields in eq. ([gensusylagr]) using eq. ([solveforD]), one finds that the complete scalar potential is (recall that <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(-V\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V(\phi,\phi^*) = F^{*i} F_i + {{1\over 2}}\sum_a D^a D^a = W_i^* W^i +
{{1\over 2}}\sum_a g_a^2 (\phi^* T^a \phi)^2.
\label{fdpot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The two types of terms in this expression are called “<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term” and “<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term” contributions, respectively. In the second term in eq. ([fdpot]), we have now written an explicit sum <span class="math inline">\(\sum_a\)</span> to cover the case that the gauge group has several distinct factors with different gauge couplings <span class="math inline">\(g_a\)</span>. [For instance, in the MSSM the three factors <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> have different gauge couplings <span class="math inline">\(g_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^\prime\)</span>.] Since <span class="math inline">\(V(\phi,\phi^*)\)</span> is a sum of squares, it is always greater than or equal to zero for every field configuration. It is an interesting and unique feature of supersymmetric theories that the scalar potential is completely determined by the <span><em>other</em></span> interactions in the theory. The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms are fixed by Yukawa couplings and fermion mass terms, and the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-terms are fixed by the gauge interactions.</p>
<p>By using Noether’s procedure [see eq. ([Noether])], one finds the conserved supercurrent <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
J_\alpha^\mu &amp;\!\!\!=\!\!\!&amp;
(\sigma^\nu{\overline\sigma}^\mu \psi_i)_\alpha\, \nabla_\nu \phi^{*i}
+ i (\sigma^\mu \psi^{\dagger i})_\alpha\, W_i^*

\\ &amp;&amp;
{\ominus}{1\over 2 \sqrt{2}}
(\sigma^\nu {\overline\sigma}^\rho \sigma^\mu
\lambda^{\dagger a})_\alpha\, F^a_{\nu\rho}
+ {i\over {\sqrt{2}}} g_a \phi^* T^a \phi
\&gt; (\sigma^\mu \lambda^{\dagger a})_\alpha , \&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{supercurrent}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> generalizing the expression given in eq. ([WZsupercurrent]) for the Wess-Zumino model. This result will be useful when we discuss certain aspects of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in section [subsec:origins.gravitino].</p>
<h2 id="subsec:susylagr.summary"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Summary: How to build a supersymmetric model</h2>
<p>In a renormalizable supersymmetric field theory, the interactions and masses of all particles are determined just by their gauge transformation properties and by the superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. By construction, we found that <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> had to be a holomorphic function of the complex scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>, which are always defined to transform under supersymmetry into left-handed Weyl fermions. In an equivalent language, to be covered in section [sec:superfields], <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is said to be a function of chiral <span><em>superfields</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="superfields">@superfields</span>. A superfield is a single object that contains as components all of the bosonic, fermionic, and auxiliary fields within the corresponding supermultiplet, for example <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i \supset (\phi_i,\psi_i,F_i)\)</span>. (This is analogous to the way in which one often describes a weak isospin doublet or a color triplet by a multicomponent field.) The gauge quantum numbers and the mass dimension of a chiral superfield are the same as that of its scalar component. In the superfield formulation, one writes instead of eq. ([superpotentialwithlinear]) <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W &amp;=&amp; 
L^i \Phi_i +
{1\over 2}M^{ij} \Phi_i\Phi_j +{1\over 6} y^{ijk} \Phi_i \Phi_j \Phi_k 
,
\label{superpot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which implies exactly the same physics. The derivation of all of our preceding results can be obtained somewhat more elegantly using superfield methods, which have the advantage of making invariance under supersymmetry transformations manifest by defining the Lagrangian in terms of integrals over a “superspace” with fermionic as well as ordinary commuting coordinates. We have purposefully avoided this extra layer of notation so far, in favor of the more pedestrian, but more familiar and accessible, component field approach. The latter is at least more appropriate for making contact with phenomenology in a universe with supersymmetry breaking. The specification of the superpotential is really just a code for the terms that it implies in the Lagrangian, so the reader may feel free to think of the superpotential either as a function of the scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> or as the same function of the superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the supermultiplet content of the theory, the form of the superpotential is restricted by the requirement of gauge invariance [see eq. ([wgaugeinvar])]. In any given theory, only a subset of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(L^i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span> are allowed to be non-zero. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(L^i\)</span> is only allowed if <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> is a gauge singlet. (There are no such chiral supermultiplets in the MSSM with the minimal field content.) The entries of the mass matrix <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span> can only be non-zero for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> such that the supermultiplets <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_j\)</span> transform under the gauge group in representations that are conjugates of each other. (In the MSSM there is only one such term, as we will see.) Likewise, the Yukawa couplings <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span> can only be non-zero when <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_k\)</span> transform in representations that can combine to form a singlet.</p>
<p>The interactions implied by the superpotential eq. ([superpot]) (with <span class="math inline">\(L^i=0\)</span>) were listed in eqs. ([ordpot]), ([lagrchiral]), and are shown<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in Figures [fig:dim0] and [fig:dim12].

<p>For each particular Yukawa coupling of <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i \psi_j \psi_k\)</span> with strength <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span>, there must be equal couplings of <span class="math inline">\(\phi_j \psi_i \psi_k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_k \psi_i \psi_j\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span> is completely symmetric under interchange of any two of its indices as shown in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral].

<p>First, there are (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings in Figure [fig:dim12]a,b, which are entirely determined by the superpotential mass parameters <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span> and Yukawa couplings <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span>, as indicated by the second and third terms in eq. ([ordpot]). The propagators of the fermions and scalars in the theory are constructed in the usual way using the fermion mass <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span> and scalar squared mass <span class="math inline">\(M^*_{ik}M^{kj}\)</span>. The fermion mass terms <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{ij}\)</span> each lead to a chirality-changing insertion in the fermion propagator; note the directions of the arrows in Figure [fig:dim12]c,d.

<p>Figures [fig:gauge]a and [fig:gauge]b are the interactions of gauge bosons, which derive from the first term in eq. ([lagrgauge]). In the MSSM these are exactly the same as the well-known QCD gluon and electroweak gauge boson vertices of the Standard Model. (We do not show the interactions of ghost fields, which are necessary only for consistent loop amplitudes.) Figures [fig:gauge]c,d,e,f are just the standard interactions between gauge bosons and fermion and scalar fields that must occur in any gauge theory because of the form of the covariant derivative; they come from eqs. ([ordtocovlambda]) and ([ordtocovphi])-([ordtocovpsi]) inserted in the kinetic part of the Lagrangian. Figure [fig:gauge]c shows the coupling of a gaugino to a gauge boson; the gaugino line in a Feynman diagram is traditionally drawn as a solid fermion line superimposed on a wavy line. In Figure [fig:gauge]g we have the coupling of a gaugino to a chiral fermion and a complex scalar [the first term in the second line of eq. ([gensusylagr])]. One can think of this as the “supersymmetrization” of Figure [fig:gauge]e or [fig:gauge]f; any of these three vertices may be obtained from any other (up to a factor of <span class="math inline">\({\sqrt{2}}\)</span>) by replacing two of the particles by their supersymmetric partners. There is also an interaction in Figure [fig:gauge]h which is just like Figure [fig:gauge]g but with all arrows reversed, corresponding to the complex conjugate term in the Lagrangian [the second term in the second line in eq. ([gensusylagr])]. Finally in Figure [fig:gauge]i we have a scalar quartic interaction vertex [the last term in eq. ([fdpot])], which is also determined by the gauge coupling.</p>
<p>The results of this section can be used as a recipe for constructing the supersymmetric interactions for any model. In the case of the MSSM, we already know the gauge group, particle content and the gauge transformation properties, so it only remains to decide on the superpotential. This we will do in section [subsec:mssm.superpotential]. However, first we will revisit the structure of supersymmetric Lagrangians in section [sec:superfields] using the manifestly supersymmetric formalism of superspace and superfields, and then describe the general form of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in section [sec:soft].</p>
<h1 id="sec:superfields"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Superspace and superfields</h1>
<p>In this section, the basic ideas of superspace and superfields are covered. These ideas provide elegant tools for understanding the structure of supersymmetric theories, and are essential for analyzing and communicating ideas about the formal structure of supersymmetry in the most succinct ways. However, they are also not strictly necessary; the discussion given above shows how supersymmetry can be defined and studied completely without the superspace and superfield notation. The reader who is mainly interested in phenomenological aspects of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model is encouraged to skip this section, especially on a first reading. The other sections (mostly) do not depend on it.</p>
<h2 id="supercoordinates-general-superfields-and-superspace-differentiation-and-integrationsubsecsupercoordinates"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Supercoordinates, general superfields, and superspace differentiation and integration[subsec:supercoordinates]</h2>
<p>Supersymmetry can be given a geometric interpretation using superspace, a manifold obtained by adding four fermionic coordinates to the usual bosonic spacetime coordinates <span class="math inline">\(t,x,y,z\)</span>. Points in superspace are labeled by coordinates: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
x^\mu,\&gt; \theta^\alpha,\&gt; \theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}.
\label{eq:supercoordinates}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> are constant complex anti-commuting two-component spinors with dimension [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^{-1/2}\)</span>. In the superspace formulation, the component fields of a supermultiplet are united into a single superfield, a function of these superspace coordinates. We will see below that infinitesimal translations in superspace coincide with the global supersymmetry transformations that we have already found in component field language. Superspace thus allows an elegant and manifestly invariant definition of supersymmetric field theories.</p>
<p>Differentiation and integration on spaces with anti-commuting coordinates are defined by analogy with ordinary commuting variables. Consider first, as a warm-up example, a single anti-commuting variable <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> (carrying no spinor indices). Because <span class="math inline">\(\eta^2=0\)</span>, a power series expansion in <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> always terminates, and a general function is linear in <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
f(\eta) = f_0 + \eta f_1.
\label{eq:deffuneta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> may be functions of other commuting or anti-commuting variables, but not <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>. One of them will be anti-commuting (Grassmann-odd), and the other is commuting (Grassmann-even). Then define: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{df}{d\eta} = f_1 .
\label{eq:defdereta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The differential operator <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{d\eta}\)</span> anticommutes with every Grassmann-odd object, so that if <span class="math inline">\(\eta&#39;\)</span> is distinct from <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> but also anti-commuting, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d(\eta&#39;\eta)}{d\eta} = -\frac{d(\eta\eta&#39;)}{d\eta} = -\eta&#39;.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> To define an integration operation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>, take <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d\eta = 0, \qquad\quad
\int d\eta\&gt; \eta = 1,
\label{eq:defderetabasis}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and impose linearity. This defines the Berezin integral <span class="citation" data-cites="Berezin">@Berezin</span> for Grassmann variables, and gives <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d\eta \,f(\eta)  
\&gt; = \&gt; f_1 .
\label{eq:definteta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Comparing eqs. ([eq:defdereta]) and ([eq:definteta]) shows the peculiar fact that differentiation and integration are the same thing for an anti-commuting variable. The definition eq. ([eq:defderetabasis]) is motivated by the fact that it implies translation invariance, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d\eta \&gt; f(\eta + \eta&#39;) = \int d\eta \&gt; f(\eta),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and the integration by parts formula <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d\eta \&gt; \frac{df}{d\eta} = 0,
\label{eq:funtheoeta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in analogy with the fundamental theorem of the calculus for ordinary commuting variables. The anti-commuting Dirac delta function has the defining property <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d\eta\&gt; \delta(\eta - \eta&#39;)\, f(\eta) &amp;=&amp; f(\eta&#39;),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which leads to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta (\eta - \eta&#39;) &amp;=&amp; \eta - \eta&#39;.\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>For superspace with coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu, \theta^\alpha, \theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}\)</span>, any superfield can be expanded in a power series in the anti-commuting variables, with components that are functions of <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>. Since there are two independent components of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\alpha\)</span> and likewise for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}\)</span>, the expansion always terminates, with each term containing at most two <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>’s and two <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span>’s. A general superfield is therefore: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
S(x, \theta, \theta^\dagger) = 
a
+ \theta \xi 
+ \theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt} \chi^\dagger 
+ \theta\theta b 
+ {\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}c 
+ {\theta^\dagger{\overline\sigma}^\mu\theta}v_\mu

+ \theta \theta  \theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt} \zeta^\dagger 
+ \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}d.
\label{eq:gensuperfield}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> To see that there are no other independent contributions, note the identities <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\theta_\alpha \theta_\beta \&gt;=\&gt; \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\alpha\beta} \theta\theta
,
\qquad
\theta^\dagger_{\dot \alpha}\hspace{-1pt} \theta^\dagger_{\dot \beta}

\&gt;=\&gt; \frac{1}{2} 
\sigma^\mu_{\alpha\dot\beta}
({\theta^\dagger{\overline\sigma}_\mu\theta})
,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> derived from eqs. ([eq:defepstwo]) and ([eq:feif]). These can be used to rewrite any term into the forms given in eq. ([eq:gensuperfield]). Some other identities involving the anti-commuting coordinates that are useful in checking results below are: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

{\ominus}\eta^{\mu\nu} {\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These follow from identities already given in section [sec:notations].</p>
<p>The general superfield <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> could be either commuting or anti-commuting, and could carry additional Lorentz vector or spinor indices. For simplicity, let us assume for the rest of this subsection that it is Grassmann-even and carries no other indices. Then, without further restrictions, the components of the general superfield <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are 8 bosonic fields <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_\mu\)</span>, and 4 two-component fermionic fields <span class="math inline">\(\xi,\chi^\dagger,\eta,\zeta^\dagger\)</span>. All of these are complex functions of <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>. The numbers of bosons and fermions do agree (8 complex, or 16 real, degrees of freedom for each), but there are too many of them to match either the chiral or vector supermultiplets encountered in the previous section. This means that the general superfield is a reducible representation of supersymmetry. In sections [chiralsuperfields] and [subsec:vectorsuperfields] below, we will see how chiral and vector superfields are obtained by imposing constraints on the general case eq. ([eq:gensuperfield]).</p>
<p>Derivatives with respect to the anti-commuting coordinates are defined by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\alpha} (\theta^\beta)

(\theta^\dagger_{\dot\beta}) \&gt;=\&gt; 0 ,
\qquad
\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} 
(\theta^\dagger_{\dot\beta}) \&gt;=\&gt; 
\delta^{\dot\alpha}_{\dot\beta} ,
\qquad
\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} 
(\theta^{\beta}) \&gt;=\&gt; 0 .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\alpha}(\psi\theta) = \psi_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta_\alpha}(\psi\theta) = -\psi^\alpha\)</span> for an anti-commuting spinor <span class="math inline">\(\psi_\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\alpha}(\theta\theta) = 2 \theta_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta_\alpha}(\theta\theta) = -2 \theta^\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>To integrate over superspace, define <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\&gt;=\&gt; -\frac{1}{4} d\theta^\alpha d \theta^\beta \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}

<p>It is probably not obvious yet that the supersymmetry transformations as just defined coincide with those found in section [sec:susylagr]. This will become clear below when we discuss the specific form of chiral and vector superfields and the Lagrangians that govern their dynamics. Meanwhile, however, we can compute the anticommutators of <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q^\dagger\)</span> from eqs. ([eq:defQhat]), ([eq:defQdaggerhat]), with the results: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt; 0.
\label{eq:diffopSUSYalgebra2}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here, the differential operator generating spacetime translations is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\hat P_\mu = {\ominus}i \partial_\mu.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Eqs. ([eq:diffopSUSYalgebra1])-([eq:diffopSUSYalgebra2]) have the same form as the supersymmetry algebra given in eqs. ([nonschsusyalg1]), ([nonschsusyalg2]).</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind the conceptual distinction between the unhatted objects <span class="math inline">\(Q_\alpha, Q^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}, P^\mu\)</span> appearing in section [subsec:susylagr.freeWZ], which are operators acting on the Hilbert space of quantum states, and the corresponding hatted objects <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q_\alpha, \hat Q^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}, \hat P^\mu\)</span>, which are differential operators acting on functions in superspace. For any superfield quantum mechanical operator <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in the Heisenberg picture, the two kinds of operations are related by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>To construct Lagrangians in superspace, we will later want to use derivatives with respect to the anti-commuting coordinates, just as ordinary Lagrangians are built using spacetime derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu\)</span>. We will also use such derivatives to impose constraints on the general superfield in a way consistent with the supersymmetry transformations. However, $ / ^$ is not appropriate for this purpose, because it is not supersymmetric covariant: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon \left (\frac{\partial S}{\partial \theta^\alpha} \right )
\&gt;\not=\&gt;
\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\alpha} (\delta_\epsilon S),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and similarly for $ / ^_{} $. This means that derivatives of a superfield with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\theta_\alpha\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> are not superfields; they do not transform the right way. To fix this, it is useful to define the chiral covariant derivatives: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
D_\alpha &amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\alpha} 
-i (\sigma^\mu \theta^\dagger)_\alpha \partial_\mu
,
\qquad\qquad
D^\alpha \&gt;=\&gt; -\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta_\alpha} 
+i (\theta^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu)^\alpha \partial_\mu
.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> For a Grassmann-even superfield <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, one can then define the anti-chiral covariant derivative to obey: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} S^* \equiv (D_\alpha S)^*,
\label{eq:defDcon}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\overline D}^{\dot\alpha} &amp;=&amp; 
\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}} 
-i ({\overline\sigma}^\mu \theta)^{\dot\alpha} \partial_\mu
,
\qquad\qquad\&gt;
{\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \&gt;=\&gt; 
-\frac{\partial\phantom{x}}{\partial\theta^{\dagger\dot\alpha}} 
+i (\theta \sigma^\mu)_{\dot\alpha} \partial_\mu
.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> One may now check that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Bigl \lbrace \hat Q_\alpha ,\, D_\beta \Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt;
\Bigl \lbrace \hat Q^\dagger_{\dot\alpha} ,\, D_\beta \Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt;
\Bigl \lbrace \hat Q_\alpha ,\, {\overline D}_{\dot\beta} \Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt;
\Bigl \lbrace \hat Q^\dagger_{\dot\alpha} ,\, {\overline D}_{\dot\beta} 
\Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt; 0 .
\label{eq:QDanticommute}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Using the supersymmetry transformation definition of eq. ([eq:superspacedefsupertrans]), it follows that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon \left ( D_\alpha S \right )
= D_\alpha\left ( \delta_\epsilon  S \right ),
\qquad
\qquad
\delta_\epsilon \left ( {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} S \right )
= {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \left ( \delta_\epsilon  S \right )
.
\label{eq:Dsupercon}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus the derivatives <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> are indeed supersymmetric covariant; acting on superfields, they return superfields. This crucial property makes them useful both for defining constraints on superfields in a covariant way, and for defining superspace Lagrangians involving anti-commuting spinor coordinate derivatives. These derivatives are linear differential operators, obeying product rules exactly analogous to eq. ([eq:grassmanproductrule]).</p>
<p>The chiral and anti-chiral covariant derivatives also can be checked to satisfy the useful anticommutation identities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Bigl \lbrace D_\alpha,\, {\overline D}_{\dot\beta} \Bigr \rbrace  &amp;=&amp; 
2 i \sigma^\mu_{\alpha\dot\beta}\partial_\mu,
\label{eq:diffopderivs}
\\
\Bigl \lbrace D_\alpha,\, D_{\beta} \Bigr \rbrace &amp;=&amp; 0,\qquad\quad
\Bigl \lbrace {\overline D}_{\dot \alpha},\,
              {\overline D}_{\dot\beta} \Bigr \rbrace \&gt;=\&gt; 0.
\label{eq:diffopderivs2}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This has exactly the same form as the supersymmetry algebra in eqs. ([eq:diffopSUSYalgebra1]) and ([eq:diffopSUSYalgebra2]), but <span class="math inline">\(D, {\overline D}\)</span> should not be confused with the differential operators for supersymmetry transformations, <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q, \hat Q^\dagger\)</span>. The operators <span class="math inline">\(D, {\overline D}\)</span> do not represent a second supersymmetry.</p>
<p>The reader might be wondering why we use an overline notation for <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}\)</span>, but a dagger for <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q^\dagger\)</span>. The reason is that the dagger and the overline denote different kinds of conjugation. The dagger on <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q\)</span> represents Hermitian conjugation in the same sense that <span class="math inline">\(\hat P = -i \partial_\mu\)</span> is an Hermitian differential operator on an inner product space, but the overline on <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}\)</span> represents complex conjugation in the same sense that <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu\)</span> is a real differential operator, with <span class="math inline">\((\partial_\mu \phi)^* = \partial_\mu \phi^*\)</span>. Recall that if we define the inner product on the space of functions of <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span> by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \psi | \phi \rangle = \int \!d^4x\&gt; \psi^*(x) \phi(x),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> then, using integration by parts, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \psi| \hat P \phi \rangle = \left (\langle \phi| \hat P \psi \rangle\right )^*\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Similarly, the dagger on the differential operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q^\dagger\)</span> denotes Hermitian conjugation with respect to the inner product defined by integration of complex superfields over superspace. To see this, define, for any two classical superfields <span class="math inline">\(S(x,\theta,\theta^\dagger)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T(x,\theta,\theta^\dagger)\)</span>, the inner product: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle T | S \rangle = \int d^4x\int\! d^2\theta\! \int\! d^2\theta^\dagger\&gt; T^* S.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now one finds, by integration by parts over superspace, that with the definitions in eqs. ([eq:defQhat]) and ([eq:defQdaggerhat]), <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle T | \hat Q^\dagger_{\dot\alpha} S \rangle = 
\left ( \langle S |\hat Q_\alpha T \rangle \right )^* .
\label{eq:TSQcon}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In contrast, the definition of <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}\)</span> in eq. ([eq:defDcon]) is analogous to the equation <span class="math inline">\((\partial_\mu \phi)^* = \partial_\mu \phi^*\)</span> for functions on ordinary spacetime; in that sense, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu\)</span> is a real differential operator, and similarly <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> is the conjugate of <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span>. This is more than just notation; if we defined <span class="math inline">\(D^\dagger_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span> in a way analogous to eq. ([eq:TSQcon]), then one can check that it would not be equal to <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> as defined above. Note that the dagger on the quantum field theory operator <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger_{\alpha}\)</span> (without the hat) represents yet another sort of Hermitian conjugation, in the quantum mechanics Hilbert space sense.</p>
<p>It is useful to note that, using eq. ([eq:totalthetaderivsvanish]), <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d^2\theta \,D_\alpha \mbox{(anything)} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
\int d^2\theta^\dagger \,{\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \mbox{(anything)}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> are each total derivatives with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>. This enables integration by parts in superspace of Lagrangian terms with respect to either <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span>. Another useful fact is that acting three consecutive times with either of <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> always produces a vanishing result: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
D_\alpha D_\beta D_\gamma \mbox{(anything)} = 0 \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
{\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} {\overline D}_{\dot\beta} {\overline D}_{\dot\gamma} \mbox{(anything)} = 0.
\label{eq:DDDeq0}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This follows from eq. ([eq:diffopderivs2]), and is true essentially because the spinor indices on the anti-commuting derivatives can only have two values.</p>

<p>As the notation chosen in eq. ([eq:vectorsuperfieldexpansion]) suggests, a vector superfield that is used to represent a gauge supermultiplet contains gauge boson, gaugino, and gauge auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(A^\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> as components. (Such a vector superfield <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> must be dimensionless in order for the component fields to have the canonical mass dimensions.) However, there are other component fields in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> that did not appear in sections [subsec:susylagr.gauge] and [subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter]. They are: a real scalar <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, a two-component fermion <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, and a complex scalar <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, with mass dimensions respectively 0, <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, and 1. These are additional auxiliary fields, which can be “supergauged” away. To see this, suppose <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the vector superfield for a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge symmetry, and consider the “supergauge transformation”: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V &amp;\rightarrow &amp; V + i (\Omega^* - \Omega),
\label{eq:u1superfieldgt}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is a chiral superfield gauge transformation parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \phi + \sqrt{2}\theta \psi + \theta\theta F+\ldots\)</span>. In components, this transformation is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
a &amp;\rightarrow&amp; a + i (\phi^* - \phi),
\\
\xi_\alpha &amp;\rightarrow&amp; \xi_\alpha - i\sqrt{2} \psi_\alpha ,
\\
b &amp;\rightarrow&amp; b - iF ,
\\
A_\mu &amp;\rightarrow&amp; A_\mu {\oplus}\partial_\mu (\phi + \phi^*) ,
\label{eq:AgaugetransfromLambda}
\\
\lambda_\alpha &amp;\rightarrow&amp; \lambda_\alpha ,
\\
D &amp;\rightarrow&amp; D.
\label{eq:DgaugetransfromLambda}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Equation ([eq:AgaugetransfromLambda]) shows that eq. ([eq:u1superfieldgt]) provides the vector boson field with the usual gauge transformation, with parameter 2Re<span class="math inline">\((\phi)\)</span>. By requiring the gauge transformation to take a supersymmetric form, it follows that appropriate independent choices of Im<span class="math inline">\((\phi)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\psi_\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> can also change <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\xi_\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> arbitrarily. Thus the supergauge transformation eq. ([eq:u1superfieldgt]) has ordinary gauge transformations as a special case.</p>
<p>In particular, supergauge transformations can eliminate the auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\xi_\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> completely. A superspace Lagrangian for a vector superfield must be invariant under the supergauge transformation eq. ([eq:u1superfieldgt]) in the Abelian case, or a suitable generalization given below for the non-Abelian case. After making a supergauge transformation to eliminate <span class="math inline">\(a,\xi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the vector superfield is said to be in Wess-Zumino gauge, and is simply given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_{{\rm WZ}\&gt;{\rm gauge}} \&gt;=\&gt; 
{\theta^\dagger{\overline\sigma}^\mu\theta}A_\mu 
+ {\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\theta \lambda 
+ \theta \theta  \theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt} \lambda^\dagger  
+ \frac{1}{2} \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}D.
\label{eq:WZgauge}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The restriction of the vector superfield to Wess-Zumino gauge is not consistent with the linear superspace version of supersymmetry transformations. This is because <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \delta_{\epsilon} (V_{{\rm WZ}\&gt;{\rm gauge}})\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\({\oplus}\theta^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \epsilon A_\mu {\ominus}\theta \sigma^\mu \epsilon^\dagger A_\mu + \theta\theta \epsilon^\dagger \lambda^\dagger + \theta^\dagger\theta^\dagger \epsilon \lambda\)</span>, and so the supersymmetry transformation of the Wess-Zumino gauge vector superfield is not in Wess-Zumino gauge. However, a supergauge transformation can always restore <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{\epsilon} (V_{{\rm WZ}\&gt;{\rm gauge}})\)</span> to Wess-Zumino gauge. Adopting Wess-Zumino gauge is equivalent to partially fixing the supergauge, while still maintaining the full freedom to do ordinary gauge transformations.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-lagrangian-in-superspacesuperspacelagr"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> How to make a Lagrangian in superspace[superspacelagr]</h2>
<p>So far, we have been concerned with the structural features of fields in superspace. We now turn to the dynamical issue of how to construct manifestly supersymmetric actions. A key observation is that the integral of any superfield over all of superspace is automatically invariant: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon A = 0,\quad\mbox{for}\quad
A = \int d^4x \int d^2\theta d^2 \theta^\dagger \&gt; S(x, \theta, \theta^\dagger). 
\label{eq:defsuperspaceaction}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This follows immediately from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat Q^\dagger\)</span> as defined in eqs. ([eq:defQhat]), ([eq:defQdaggerhat]) are sums of total derivatives with respect to the superspace coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu,\theta,\theta^\dagger\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon \hat Q + \epsilon^\dagger \hat Q^\dagger)S\)</span> vanishes upon integration. As a check, eq. ([eq:gensuperfieldtransd]) shows that the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\)</span> component of a superfield transforms into a total spacetime derivative.</p>
<p>Therefore, the action governing the dynamics of a theory can have contributions of the form of eq. ([eq:defsuperspaceaction]), with reality of the action demanding that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is some real (vector) superfield <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. From eq. ([eq:supertranslation]), we see that the principle of global supersymmetric invariance is embodied in the requirement that the action should be an integral over superspace which is unchanged under rigid translations of the superspace coordinates. To obtain the Lagrangian density <span class="math inline">\({\cal L}(x)\)</span>, one integrates over only the fermionic coordinates. This is often written in the notation: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[V]_D \,\equiv\, \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\&gt; V(x,\theta,\theta^\dagger) 
\,=\, 
V(x,\theta,\theta^\dagger) \Bigl |_{\theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}}
\,=\,
\frac{1}{2} D {\oplus}\frac{1}{4} \partial_\mu \partial^\mu a
\label{eq:DtermLag}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> using eq. ([eq:heckuvajobtimmy]) and the form of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in eq. ([eq:vectorsuperfieldexpansion]) for the last equality. This is referred to as a <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contribution to the Lagrangian (note that the <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu \partial^\mu a\)</span> part will vanish upon integration <span class="math inline">\(\int d^4 x\)</span>).</p>
<p>Another type of contribution to the action can be inferred from the fact that the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term of a chiral superfield also transforms into a total derivative under a supersymmetry transformation, see eq. ([eq:runningupthathill]). This implies that one can have a contribution to the Lagrangian density of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[\Phi]_F \,\equiv\, \Phi \Bigl |_{\theta\theta} \,=\, 
\int d^2\theta\, \Phi \Bigl |_{\theta^\dagger =0} \,=\, 
\int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\,
\delta^{(2)}(\theta^\dagger)
\,
\Phi \&gt;=\&gt;F,
\label{eq:PhiF}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> using the form of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> in eq. ([eq:Phiinxrep]) for the last equality. This satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{\epsilon} (\int d^4 x [\Phi]_F) = 0\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term of a chiral superfield is complex in general, but the action must be real, which can be ensured if this type of contribution to the Lagrangian is accompanied by its complex conjugate: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[\Phi]_F + {\rm c.c.} \&gt;=\&gt; 
\int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\,
\left [ 
\delta^{(2)}(\theta^\dagger) 
\,
\Phi 
+
\delta^{(2)}(\theta) 
\,
\Phi^* 
\right ].
\label{eq:FtermLag}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Note that the identification of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term component of a chiral superfield is the same in the <span class="math inline">\((x^\mu,\theta,\theta^\dagger)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((y^\mu,\theta,\theta^\dagger)\)</span> coordinates, in the sense that in both cases, one simply isolates the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\theta\)</span> component. This follows because the difference between <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^\mu\)</span> is higher order in <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span>. It is a useful trick, because many calculations involving chiral superfields are simpler to carry out in terms of <span class="math inline">\(y^\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another possible try would be to take the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term of a chiral superfield. However, this is a waste of time, because <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[\Phi]_D 
\,=\, \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\&gt; \Phi 
\,=\, 
\Phi \Bigl |_{\theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}}
\,=\,
\frac{1}{4} \partial_\mu \partial^\mu \phi,
\label{eq:tryPhiD}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the last equality follows from eq. ([eq:Phiinxrep]), and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the scalar component of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. Equation ([eq:tryPhiD]) is a total derivative, so adding it (and its complex conjugate) to the Lagrangian density has no effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the two ways of making a supersymmetric Lagrangian are to take the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term component of a real superfield, and to take the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term component of a chiral superfield, plus the complex conjugate. When building a Lagrangian, the real superfield <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> used in eq. ([eq:DtermLag]) and the chiral superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> used in eq. ([eq:FtermLag]) are usually composites, built out of more fundamental superfields. However, contributions from fundamental fields <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> are allowed, when <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the vector superfield for an Abelian gauge symmetry and when <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is a singlet under all symmetries.</p>
<p>It is always possible to rewrite a <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> term contribution to a Lagrangian as an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> term contribution, by the trick of noticing that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\overline D}{\overline D}(\theta^\dagger \theta^\dagger) &amp;=&amp; 
DD(\theta\theta) \&gt;\,=\,\&gt; -4,
\label{eq:DDthetatheta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{(2)}(\theta^\dagger) = \theta^\dagger\theta^\dagger\)</span> from eq. ([eq:deltathetatheta]). Thus, by integrating by parts twice with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[V]_D
&amp;=&amp;
-\frac{1}{4} \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\, V

As noted in section [chiralsuperfields], <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}{\overline D}V\)</span> is always a chiral superfield. If <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is real, then the imaginary part of eq. ([eq:rewriteDasF]) is a total derivative, and the result can be rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{8} \bigl [{\overline D}{\overline D}V \bigr ]_F + {\rm c.c.}\)</span></p>

<p>In section [chiralsuperfields], we verified that the chiral superfield components have the same supersymmetry transformations as the Wess-Zumino model fields.

For <span class="math inline">\(i=j\)</span>, eq. ([eq:PhistariPhij]) is a real (vector) superfield, and the massless free-field Lagrangian for each chiral superfield is just obtained by taking the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\)</span> component: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[\Phi^* \Phi]_D = \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger \,\Phi^* \Phi

Equation ([eq:freelagrphisuperspace]) is exactly the Lagrangian density obtained in section [subsec:susylagr.freeWZ] for the massless free Wess-Zumino model.</p>
<p>To obtain the superpotential interaction and mass terms, recall that products of chiral superfields are also superfields. For example, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

- \psi_j \psi_k \phi_i

\label{eq:superfieldPhiPhiPhi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the presentation has been simplified by taking the component fields on the right sides to be functions of <span class="math inline">\(y^\mu\)</span> as given in eq. ([eq:defineycoord]). More generally, any holomorphic function of a chiral superfields is a chiral superfield. So, one may form a complete Lagrangian as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}(x) &amp;=&amp; [\Phi^{*i} \Phi_i]_D + 
\left ( \left  [ W(\Phi_i) \right ]_F
+ {\rm c.c.} \right ),
\label{eq:oslo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W(\Phi_i)\)</span> can be any holomorphic function of the chiral superfields (but not anti-chiral superfields) taken as complex variables, and coincides with the superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W(\phi_i)\)</span> that was treated in subsection [subsec:susylagr.chiral] as a function of the scalar components. For <span class="math inline">\(W = \frac{1}{2} M^{ij} \Phi_i \Phi_j + \frac{1}{6} y^{ijk} \Phi_i \Phi_j \Phi_k\)</span>, the result of eq. ([eq:oslo]) is exactly the same as eq. ([lagrchiral]), after writing in component form using eqs. ([eq:freelagrphisuperspace]), ([eq:superfieldPhiPhi]), ([eq:superfieldPhiPhiPhi]) and integrating out the auxiliary fields.</p>
<p>It is instructive to obtain the superfield equations of motion from the Lagrangian eq. ([eq:oslo]). The quickest way to do this is to first use the remarks at the very end of section [superspacelagr] to rewrite the Lagrangian density as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}(x) &amp;=&amp; 
\int d^2\theta \left [ -\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\Phi^{*i} \Phi_i  +
W(\Phi_i) \right ]
\,+ \,
\int d^2\theta^\dagger \left [W(\Phi_i)\right ]^*.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now varying with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> immediately gives the superfield equation of motion: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
0 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\Phi^{*i} + \frac{\delta W}{\delta \Phi_i} ,
\label{eq:superfieldeqmot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and its complex conjugate, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
0&amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{4} DD \Phi_i + \frac{\delta W^*}{\delta \Phi^{*i}} .
\label{eq:superfieldeqmotCON}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These are equivalent to the component-level equations of motion as can be found from the Lagrangian in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral]. To verify this, it is easiest to write eq. ([eq:superfieldeqmot]) in the coordinate system <span class="math inline">\((y^\mu, \theta, \theta^\dagger)\)</span>, in which the first term has the simple form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\Phi^{*i}
= F^*(y) - i \sqrt{2} \theta\sigma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi^{\dagger i}(y)
{\oplus}\theta\theta \partial_\mu \partial^\mu \phi^{*i}(y) .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Because this is a chiral (not anti-chiral) superfield, it is simpler to write the components as functions of <span class="math inline">\(y^\mu\)</span> as shown, not <span class="math inline">\(y^{\mu *}\)</span>, even though the left-hand side involves <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>For an alternate method, consider a Lagrangian density <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> on the full superspace, so that the action is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
A &amp;=&amp; \int d^4 x \hspace{-0.5pt} \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger\, V,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(V(S_i, \, D_\alpha S_i, \, {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} S_i)\)</span> assumed to be a function of general dynamical superfields <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> and their chiral and anti-chiral first derivatives. Then the superfield equations of motion obtained by variation of the action are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial V}{\partial S_i}
- D_\alpha \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial (D_\alpha S_i)} 
\right ) 
- {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \left (\frac{\partial V}{\partial 
({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} S_i)} \right )
.
\label{eq:superspaceeqmo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In the case of the Lagrangian for chiral superfields eq. ([eq:oslo]), Lagrange multipliers <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda^{*i\dot \alpha}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda^{\alpha}_i\)</span> can be introduced to enforce the chiral and anti-chiral superfield constraints on <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^{*i}\)</span> respectively. The Lagrangian density on superspace is then: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V &amp;=&amp; 
\Lambda^{*i\dot \alpha} {\overline D}_{\dot \alpha} \Phi_i
+ \Lambda^{\alpha}_i D_{\alpha} \Phi^{*i}
+ \Phi^{*i} \Phi_i 
+ \delta^{(2)}(\theta^\dagger) W(\Phi_i)
+ \delta^{(2)}(\theta) [W(\Phi_i)]^* .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Variation with respect to the Lagrange multipliers just gives the constraints <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot \alpha} \Phi_i = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_{\alpha} \Phi^{*i} = 0\)</span>. Applying eq. ([eq:superspaceeqmo]) to the superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^{*i}\)</span> leads to equations of motion: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
0 &amp;=&amp;  
\Phi^{*i} +
\delta^{(2)}(\theta^\dagger) \frac{\delta W}{\delta \Phi_i}
- {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \Lambda^{*i\dot \alpha},
\\
0 &amp;=&amp; 
\Phi_{i} +
\delta^{(2)}(\theta) \frac{\delta W^*}{\delta \Phi^{*i}}
- D_{\alpha} \Lambda^{\alpha}_i 
.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now acting on these equations with <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{4} DD\)</span> respectively, and applying eqs. ([eq:deltathetatheta]) and ([eq:DDthetatheta]), one again obtains eqs. ([eq:superfieldeqmot]) and ([eq:superfieldeqmotCON]).</p>

\label{eq:Walphagitwo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first equality follows from eq. ([eq:anti-chiralsuperfieldconstraint]) because <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^*\)</span> is anti-chiral, the second and fourth equalities from eq. ([eq:leftchiralsuperfieldconstraint]) because <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is chiral, and the third from eq. ([eq:diffopderivs]).</p>
<p>To see how the component fields fit into <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}_\alpha\)</span>, it is convenient to temporarily specialize to Wess-Zumino gauge as in eq. ([eq:WZgauge]), and then convert to the coordinates <span class="math inline">\((y^\mu, \theta, \theta^\dagger)\)</span> as defined in eq. ([eq:defineycoord]), with the result <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V(y^\mu, \theta,\theta^\dagger) &amp;=&amp;
{\theta^\dagger{\overline\sigma}^\mu\theta}A_\mu(y) 
+ {\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\theta \lambda(y) 
+ \theta \theta  \theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt} \lambda^\dagger(y)  
+ \frac{1}{2} \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\left [D(y)
+ i \partial_\mu A^\mu(y) \right ].\phantom{xxx}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now application of eqs. ([eq:Dinyrep]), ([eq:Ddaggerinyrep]) yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}_\alpha(y,\theta,\theta^\dagger)
&amp;=&amp; 
\lambda_\alpha + \theta_\alpha D 
{\oplus}\frac{i}{2} (\sigma^\mu{\overline\sigma}^\nu\theta)_\alpha F_{\mu\nu}
+ i \theta\theta (\sigma^\mu\partial_\mu \lambda^\dagger)_\alpha ,
\label{eq:gottawearshades}
\\
{\cal W}^{\dagger\dot\alpha}(y^*,\theta,\theta^\dagger)
&amp;=&amp;

+ i {\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}({\overline\sigma}^\mu\partial_\mu \lambda  )^{\dot\alpha},
\label{eq:futuresobright}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where all fields on the right side are understood to be functions of <span class="math inline">\(y^\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^{\mu *}\)</span> respectively, and <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\mu\nu} \,=\, \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu\end{eqnarray}\]</span> is the ordinary component field strength. Although it was convenient to derive eqs. ([eq:gottawearshades]) and ([eq:futuresobright]) in Wess-Zumino gauge, they must be true in general, because <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}^{\dagger\dot\alpha}\)</span> are supergauge invariant.</p>
<p>Equation ([eq:gottawearshades]) implies <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[{\cal W}^\alpha {\cal W}_\alpha]_F = D^2 +
2 i \lambda \sigma^\mu \partial_\mu \lambda^\dagger
-\frac{1}{2} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} 
+ \frac{i}{4} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F_{\mu\nu} F_{\rho\sigma} 
,
\label{eq:Bushwickblues}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where now all fields on the right side are functions of <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>. Integrating, and eliminating total derivative parts, one obtains the action <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\int d^4 x\, {\cal L} 
&amp;=&amp; 
\int d^4 x\, \frac{1}{4} [{\cal W}^\alpha {\cal W}_\alpha]_F + {\rm c.c.}
\,=\,
\int d^4 x\, 
\left [ 
\frac{1}{2} D^2  + 
i \lambda^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu \lambda 
- \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} 
\right ],
\phantom{xx}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in agreement with eq. ([lagrgauge]). Additionally, the integral of the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term component of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> itself is invariant under both supersymmetry [see eq. ([eq:sqrttwodeltaD])] and supergauge [see eq. ([eq:DgaugetransfromLambda])] transformations. Therefore, one can include a Fayet-Iliopoulos term <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}_{\mbox{FI}} &amp;=&amp; -2 \kappa [V]_D \&gt;=\&gt;-\kappa D,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> again dropping a total derivative. This type of term can play a role in spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, as we will discuss in section [subsec:origins.Dterm].</p>
<p>It is also possible to write the Lagrangian density eq. ([eq:Bushwickblues]) as a <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term rather than an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term. Since <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}^\alpha\)</span> is a chiral superfield, with <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot \beta} {\cal W}^\alpha = 0\)</span>, one can use eq. ([eq:defineWalpha]) to write <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}^\alpha {\cal W}_\alpha = 
-\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}({\cal W}^\alpha D_\alpha V).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Therefore, using eq. ([eq:rewriteDasF]), the Lagrangian for <span class="math inline">\(A^\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> can be rewritten as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}(x) = \int d^2\theta d^2\theta^\dagger \, \left [
\frac{1}{4}
\left (
{\cal W}^\alpha D_\alpha V 
+ {\cal W}^\dagger_{\dot\alpha} {\overline D}^{\dot\alpha} V \right ) - 2 \kappa V
\right ].\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>Next consider the coupling of the Abelian gauge field to a set of chiral superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> carrying <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>. Supergauge transformations, as in eqs. ([eq:u1superfieldgt])-([eq:DgaugetransfromLambda]), are parameterized by a non-dynamical chiral superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_i &amp;\rightarrow&amp; e^{2ig q_i \Omega} \Phi_i ,
\qquad\qquad
\Phi^{*i} \&gt;\rightarrow\&gt; e^{-2ig q_i \Omega^*} \Phi^{*i} ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the gauge coupling. In the special case that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is just a real function <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span>, independent of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span>, this reproduces the usual gauge transformations with <span class="math inline">\(A^\mu \rightarrow A^\mu {\oplus}2 \partial^\mu \phi\)</span>. The kinetic term from eq. ([eq:freelagrphisuperspace]) involves the superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^{*i} \Phi_i\)</span>, which is not supergauge invariant: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi^{*i} \Phi_i &amp;\rightarrow&amp; 
e^{2ig q_i(\Omega - \Omega^*)} \Phi^{*i} \Phi_i .
\label{eq:gtofPhistarPhi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> To remedy this, we modify the chiral superfield kinetic term in the Lagrangian to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ \Phi^{*i} e^{2 g q_i V} \Phi_i \right ]_D .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The gauge transformation of the <span class="math inline">\(e^{2 g q_i V}\)</span> factor, found from eq. ([eq:u1superfieldgt]), exactly cancels that of eq. ([eq:gtofPhistarPhi]).</p>
<p>The presence of an exponential of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in the Lagrangian is possible because <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is dimensionless. It might appear to be dangerous, because normally such a non-polynomial term would be non-renormalizable. However, the gauge dependence of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> comes to the rescue: the higher order terms can be supergauged away. In particular, evaluating <span class="math inline">\(e^{2 g q_i V}\)</span> in the Wess-Zumino gauge, the power series expansion of the exponential is simple and terminates, because <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V^2 &amp;=&amp; {\ominus}\frac{1}{2} 
\theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}A_\mu A^\mu,
\\
V^n &amp;=&amp; 0\qquad(n\geq 3),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^{2 g q_i V} = 1 + 2 g q_i ({\theta^\dagger{\overline\sigma}^\mu\theta}A_\mu + 
{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}\theta \lambda 
+ \theta\theta \theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt} \lambda^\dagger +
\frac{1}{2} \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}D )
{\ominus}g^2 q_i^2 \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}A_\mu A^\mu.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Using this, one can work out that, in Wess-Zumino gauge and up to total derivative terms, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ \Phi^{*i} e^{2 g q_i V} \Phi_i \right ]_D 
&amp;=&amp;
F^{*i} F_i 
{\ominus}{\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\phi^{*i} \nabla^\mu \phi_i
+ i \psi^{\dagger i} {\overline\sigma}^\mu {\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\psi_i
- \sqrt{2} g q_i 
( \phi^{*i} \psi_i \lambda + \lambda^\dagger \psi^{\dagger i} \phi_i)
\phantom{xx}
\nonumber \\ &amp;&amp;
+ g q_i  \phi^{*i} \phi_i D,
\label{eq:superfieldchiralkinetic}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\)</span> is the gauge-covariant spacetime derivative: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\phi_i &amp;=&amp; \partial_\mu \phi_i {\ominus}i g q_i A_\mu \phi_i,
\qquad\qquad
{\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\phi^{*i} \&gt;=\&gt; \partial_\mu \phi^{*i} {\oplus}i g q_i A_\mu 
\phi^{*i},
\\
{\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\psi_i &amp;=&amp; \partial_\mu \psi_i {\ominus}i g q_i A_\mu \psi_i .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Equation ([eq:superfieldchiralkinetic]) agrees with the specialization of eq. ([gensusylagr]) to the Abelian case.</p>
<p>In summary, the superspace Lagrangian <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} &amp;=&amp; 
 \left [ \Phi^{*i} e^{2 g q_i V} \Phi_i \right ]_D

\frac{1}{4}\left (\left [{\cal W}^\alpha {\cal W}_\alpha \right ]_F

<p>Now consider a general gauge symmetry realized on chiral superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> in a representation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with matrix generators <span class="math inline">\(T^{aj}_i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\bigl (e^{-2 i g_a \Omega^a T^a} \bigr )_j{}^i.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The gauge couplings for the irreducible components of the Lie algebra are <span class="math inline">\(g_a\)</span>. As in the Abelian case, the supergauge transformation parameters are chiral superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^a\)</span>. For each Lie algebra generator, there is a vector superfield <span class="math inline">\(V^a\)</span>, which contains the vector gauge boson and gaugino. The Lagrangian then contains a supergauge-invariant term <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} &amp;=&amp; \Bigl [ \Phi^{*i} (e^{2 g_a T^a V^a})_i{}^j \Phi_j \Bigr ]_D.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> It is convenient to define matrix-valued vector and gauge parameter superfields in the representation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:yourenotthebossofmenow}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so that one can write <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:kentuckyavenue}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> [Here chiral supermultiplet representation indices <span class="math inline">\(i,j,\ldots\)</span> are suppressed; <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> with no indices stand for the matrices defined in eq. ([eq:yourenotthebossofmenow]).] Equation ([eq:kentuckyavenue]) can be expanded, keeping terms linear in <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^\dagger\)</span>, using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, to find <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

This supergauge transformation includes ordinary gauge transformations as the special case <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^{a*} = \Omega^a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because the second term on the right side of eq. ([eq:nonAbelianVtransexpansiona]) is independent of <span class="math inline">\(V^a\)</span>, one can always do a supergauge transformation to Wess-Zumino gauge by choosing <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^{a*} - \Omega^a\)</span> appropriately, just as in the Abelian case, so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

+ \frac{1}{2} \theta\theta{\theta^\dagger\hspace{-1pt}\theta^\dagger}D^a .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> After fixing the supergauge to Wess-Zumino gauge, one still has the freedom to do ordinary gauge transformations. In the Wess-Zumino gauge, the Lagrangian contribution eq. ([eq:bigbadbeluva]) is polynomial, in agreement with what was found in component language in section [subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter]: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>To make kinetic terms and self-interactions for the vector supermultiplets in the non-Abelian case, define a field-strength chiral superfield <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}_\alpha \&gt;=\&gt; -\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\left (e^{-V} D_\alpha e^V \right),
\label{eq:definenonabelianfieldstrengthW}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> generalizing the Abelian case. Using eq. ([eq:kentuckyavenue]), one can show that it transforms under supergauge transformations as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}_\alpha &amp;\rightarrow&amp; e^{i\Omega} {\cal W}_\alpha e^{-i\Omega}
.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> (The proof makes use of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is chiral and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^\dagger\)</span> is anti-chiral, so that <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \Omega = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha \Omega^\dagger = 0\)</span>.) This implies that Tr<span class="math inline">\([W^\alpha W_\alpha]\)</span> is a supergauge-invariant chiral superfield. The contents of the parentheses in eq. ([eq:definenonabelianfieldstrengthW]) can be expanded as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^{-V} D_\alpha e^V &amp;=&amp; D_\alpha V - \frac{1}{2} [V, D_\alpha V]
+ \frac{1}{6} \left [V, \left [V, D_\alpha V\right ] \right ] + \ldots ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where again the commutators apply in the matrix sense, and only the first two terms contribute in Wess-Zumino gauge.</p>
<p>The field strength chiral superfield <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}_\alpha\)</span> defined in eq. ([eq:definenonabelianfieldstrengthW]) is matrix-valued in the representation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. One can recover an adjoint representation field strength superfield <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}^a_\alpha\)</span> from the matrix-valued one by writing <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}_\alpha = 2 g_a T^a {\cal W}^a_\alpha ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> leading to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal W}^a_\alpha &amp;=&amp; 
-\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\left (
D_\alpha V^a - i g_a f^{abc} V^b D_\alpha V^c + \ldots \right ) .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The terms shown explicitly are enough to evaluate this in components in Wess-Zumino gauge, with the result <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
({\cal W}^a_\alpha)_{\mbox{WZ gauge}}
&amp;=&amp;
\lambda^a_\alpha + \theta_\alpha D^a 
{\oplus}\frac{i}{2} (\sigma^\mu 
{\overline\sigma}^\nu \theta)_\alpha F^a_{\mu\nu} 
+ i \theta\theta (\sigma^\mu {\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\lambda^{\dagger a})_\alpha
,
\label{eq:GeneAmmons}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F^a_{\mu\nu}\)</span> is the non-Abelian field strength of eq. ([eq:YMfs]) and <span class="math inline">\({\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\)</span> is the usual gauge covariant derivative from eq. ([ordtocovlambda]).</p>
<p>The kinetic terms and self-interactions for the gauge supermultiplet fields are obtained from <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{4 k_a g_a^2} {\rm Tr}[{\cal W}^{\alpha} {\cal W}_\alpha]_F &amp;=&amp;
[{\cal W}^{a\alpha} {\cal W}^a_\alpha]_F,
\label{eq:foxforce}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which is invariant under both supersymmetry and supergauge transformations. Here the normalization of generators is assumed to be $ {}[T^a T^b] = k_a _{ab}, $ with <span class="math inline">\(k_a\)</span> usually set to <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> by convention for the defining representations of simple groups. Equation ([eq:foxforce]) is most easily evaluated in Wess-Zumino gauge using eq. ([eq:GeneAmmons]), yielding <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[{\cal W}^{a\alpha} {\cal W}^a_\alpha]_F &amp;=&amp; D^{a}D^a +
2 i \lambda^a \sigma^\mu {\nabla\hspace{-2pt}{}_\mu}\lambda^{\dagger a}
-\frac{1}{2} F^{a\mu\nu} F^a_{\mu\nu} 
+ \frac{i}{4} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F^a_{\mu\nu} F^a_{\rho\sigma} .
\label{eq:CharlieParker}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Since eq. ([eq:CharlieParker]) is supergauge invariant, the same expression is valid even outside of Wess-Zumino gauge.</p>
<p>Now we can write the general renormalizable Lagrangian for a supersymmetric gauge theory (including superpotential interactions for the chiral supermultiplets when allowed by gauge invariance): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} &amp;=&amp; \left ( \frac{1}{4}  - i \frac{g_a^2 \Theta_a}{32 \pi^2} 
\right ) 
\left [
{\cal W}^{a\alpha} {\cal W}^a_\alpha 
\right ]_F
+ {\rm c.c.}

\left [
\Phi^{*i} (e^{2g_a T^a V^a})_i{}^j \Phi_j \right]_D
+ 
\left ( [W(\Phi_i)]_F + {\rm c.c.} \right ) .
\phantom{xxxx}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This introduces and defines <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_a\)</span>, a CP-violating parameter, whose effect is to include a total derivative term in the Lagrangian density: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}_{\Theta_a} &amp;=&amp; 
\frac{g_a^2 \Theta_a}{64\pi^2} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F^a_{\mu\nu} F^a_{\rho\sigma}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In the non-Abelian case, this can have physical effects due to topologically non-trivial field configurations (instantons). For a globally non-trivial gauge configuration with integer winding number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, one has <span class="math inline">\(\int d^4 x\, \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F^a_{\mu\nu} F^a_{\rho\sigma} = 64 \pi^2 n/g_a^2\)</span> for a simple gauge group, so that the contribution to the path integral is <span class="math inline">\(\exp({i\int d^4 x\,{\cal L}_{\scriptstyle \Theta_a}}) =e^{i n \Theta_a}\)</span>. Note that for non-Abelian gauge groups, a Fayet-Iliopoulos term <span class="math inline">\(-2\kappa [V^a]_D\)</span> is not allowed, because it is not a gauge singlet.</p>
<p>When the superfields are restricted to the Wess-Zumino gauge, the supersymmetry transformations are not realized linearly in superspace, but the Lagrangian is polynomial. The non-polynomial form of the superspace Lagrangian is thus seen to be a supergauge artifact. Within Wess-Zumino gauge, supersymmetry transformations are still realized, but non-linearly, as we found in sections [subsec:susylagr.gauge] and [subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter].</p>
<p>The gauge coupling <span class="math inline">\(g_a\)</span> and CP-violating angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_a\)</span> are often combined into a single holomorphic coupling: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_a &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{g_a^2} -i \frac{\Theta_a}{8 \pi^2}
\]</span> (There are several different normalization conventions for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a\)</span> in the literature.) Then, with redefined vector and field strength superfields that include <span class="math inline">\(g_a\)</span> as part of their normalization, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat V^{a} &amp;\equiv&amp; g_a V^{a},

\&gt;\,=\&gt;\,
-\frac{1}{4} {\overline D}{\overline D}\left (
D_\alpha \widehat V^a - i f^{abc} \widehat V^b D_\alpha \widehat V^c + \ldots \right ) 
,
\label{eq:holonormW}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> the gauge part of the Lagrangian is written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} &amp;=&amp; 
\frac{1}{4} 
\left [ \tau_a \widehat{\cal W}^{a \alpha}\widehat{\cal W}^{a}_{\alpha} \right ]_F 
+ {\rm c.c.}  + 
\left [

\label{eq:tauaholo}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> An advantage of this normalization convention is that when written in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat V^a\)</span>, the only appearance of the gauge coupling and <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_a\)</span> is in the <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a\)</span> in eq. ([eq:tauaholo]). It is then sometimes useful to treat the complex holomorphic coupling <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a\)</span> as a chiral superfield with an expectation value for its scalar component. An expectation value for the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term component of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a\)</span> will give gaugino masses; this is sometimes a useful way to implement the effects of explicit soft supersymmetry breaking.</p>
<h2 id="non-renormalizable-supersymmetric-lagrangianssuperspacenonrenorm"><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Non-renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangians[superspacenonrenorm]</h2>
<p>So far, we have discussed only renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangians. However, integrating out the effects of heavy states will generally lead to non-renormalizable interactions in the low-energy effective description. Furthermore, when any realistic supersymmetric theory is extended to include gravity, the resulting supergravity theory is non-renormalizable as a quantum field theory. Fortunately, the non-renormalizable interactions can be neglected for most phenomenological purposes, because they involve couplings of negative mass dimension, proportional to powers of <span class="math inline">\(1/{M_{\rm P}}\)</span> (or perhaps <span class="math inline">\(1/\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span> is some other cutoff scale associated with new physics). This means that their effects at energy scales <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> ordinarily accessible to experiment are typically suppressed by powers of <span class="math inline">\({E/{M_{\rm P}}}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(E/\Lambda_{\rm UV}\)</span>). For energies <span class="math inline">\(E{\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{\)</span>&lt;<span class="math inline">\(}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{\)</span><span class="math inline">\(}}\ifdim \wd1&gt;\wd0\kern.5\wd1\kern-.5\wd0\fi \copy0\kern-.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\copy1\ifdim\wd0&gt;\wd1 \kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}1\)</span> TeV, the consequences of non-renormalizable interactions are therefore usually far too small to be interesting.</p>
<p>Still, there are several reasons why one may need to include non-renormalizable contributions to supersymmetric Lagrangians. First, some very rare processes (like proton decay) might only be described using an effective MSSM Lagrangian that includes non-renormalizable terms. Second, one may be interested in understanding physics at very high energy scales where the suppression associated with non-renormalizable terms is not enough to stop them from being important. For example, this could be the case in the study of the very early universe, or in understanding how additional gauge symmetries get broken. Third, the non-renormalizable interactions may play a crucial role in understanding how supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the MSSM. Finally, it is sometimes useful to treat strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories using non-renormalizable effective Lagrangians, in the same way that chiral effective Lagrangians are used to study hadron physics in QCD. Unfortunately, we will not be able to treat these subjects in any sort of systematic way. Instead, we will merely sketch a few of the key elements that go into defining a non-renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangian. More detailed treatments and pointers to the literature may be found for example in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="WessBaggerbook Westbook BailinLovebook Buchbinder:1998qv Weinbergbook Freedman:2012zz Shifman:2012zz Nillesreview GGRS VNreview Bertolini:2013via">@WessBaggerbook [@Westbook; @BailinLovebook; @Buchbinder:1998qv; @Weinbergbook; @Freedman:2012zz; @Shifman:2012zz; @Nillesreview; @GGRS; @VNreview; @Bertolini:2013via]</span>.</p>
<p>A non-renormalizable gauge-invariant theory involving chiral and vector superfields can be constructed as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} &amp;=&amp; \left [ K(\Phi_i, \, \tilde \Phi^{*j}) \right ]_D
+ \left ( 
\left [\frac{1}{4}  f_{ab}(\Phi_i) \widehat{\cal W}^{a\alpha} \widehat{\cal W}^b_\alpha 
\,+\, W(\Phi_i)
\right ]_F
+ {\rm c.c.}
\right ),
\label{eq:Lnonren}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where, in order to preserve supergauge invariance, we define <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde \Phi^{*j} \equiv \bigl ( \Phi^{*} e^{V} \bigr )^j ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(V = 2 g_a T^a V^a = 2 T^a \widehat V^a\)</span> as above, and the hatted normalization of the field-strength superfields indicated in ([eq:holonormW]) has been used. Equation ([eq:Lnonren]) depends on couplings encoded in three functions of the superfields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, which we have already encountered in the special case of renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangians. More generally, it can be an arbitrary holomorphic function of the chiral superfields treated as complex variables, and must be invariant under the gauge symmetries of the theory, and has dimension [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><em>Kähler potential</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Unlike the superpotential, the Kähler potential is a function of both chiral and anti-chiral superfields, and includes the vector superfields in such a way as to be supergauge invariant. It is real, and has dimension [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. In the special case of renormalizable theories, we did not have to discuss the Kähler potential explicitly, because at tree-level it is always just <span class="math inline">\(K = \Phi_i \tilde \Phi^{i*}\)</span>. Any additive part of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> that is a chiral (or anti-chiral) superfield does not contribute to the action, since the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term of a chiral superfield is a total derivative on spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><em>gauge kinetic function</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab}(\Phi_i)\)</span>. Like the superpotential, it is itself a chiral superfield, and is a holomorphic function of the chiral superfields treated as complex variables. It is dimensionless and symmetric under interchange of its two indices <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span>, which run over the adjoint representations of the simple and Abelian component gauge groups of the model. For the non-Abelian components of the gauge group, it is always just proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ab}\)</span>, but if there are two or more Abelian components, the gauge invariance of the field-strength superfield [see eqs. ([eq:Walphagione])-([eq:Walphagitwo])] allows kinetic mixing so that <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab}\)</span> is not proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ab}\)</span> in general. In the special case of renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangians at tree level, it is independent of the chiral superfields, and just equal to <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab} = \delta_{ab}(1/g_a^2 - i \Theta_a/8 \pi^2)\)</span>, (for fewer than two Abelian components in the gauge group). More generally, it also encodes the non-renormalizable couplings of the gauge supermultiplets to the chiral supermultiplets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be emphasized that eq. ([eq:Lnonren]) is still not the most general non-renormalizable supersymmetric Lagrangian, even if one restricts to chiral and gauge vector superfields. One can also include chiral, anti-chiral, and spacetime derivatives acting on the superfields, so that for example the Kähler potential can be generalized to include dependence on <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha \Phi_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} \Phi^{*i}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(DD\Phi_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}{\overline D}\Phi^{*i}\)</span>, etc. Such terms typically have an extra suppression at low energies compared to terms without derivatives, because of the positive mass dimension of the chiral covariant derivatives. I will not discuss these possibilities below, but will only make a remark on how supergauge invariance is maintained. The chiral covariant derivative of a chiral superfield, <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha \Phi_i\)</span> is not gauge covariant unless <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> is a gauge singlet; the “covariant” in the name refers to supersymmetry transformations, not gauge transformations. However, one can define a “gauge covariant chiral covariant” derivative <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_\alpha\)</span>, whose action on a chiral superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is defined by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_\alpha \Phi &amp;\equiv&amp;
e^{-V} D_\alpha (e^{V} \Phi) ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the representation indices <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> are suppressed. From eq. ([eq:kentuckyavenue]), the supergauge transformation for <span class="math inline">\(e^{-V}\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^{-V} \rightarrow e^{i \Omega} e^{-V} e^{-i \Omega^\dagger},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^{-V} D_\alpha (e^{V} \Phi) &amp;\rightarrow&amp;
e^{i \Omega} e^{-V} e^{-i \Omega^\dagger} D_\alpha (e^{i \Omega^\dagger} e^{V} \Phi)
\&gt;=\&gt; e^{i \Omega} e^{-V} D_\alpha (e^{V} \Phi),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the equality follows from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^\dagger\)</span> is anti-chiral, and thus ignored by <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span>. This is the correct covariant transformation law under supergauge transformations. So, using <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_\alpha \Phi_i\)</span> as a building block instead of <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha \Phi_i\)</span>, one can maintain supergauge covariance along with manifest supersymmetry. Similarly, one can define building blocks: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\overline\nabla_{\dot\alpha} \Phi^* &amp;\equiv&amp; {\overline D}_{\dot\alpha} (\Phi^*e^V ) e^{-V} 
,
\\
\nabla\nabla \Phi &amp;\equiv&amp; e^{-V} DD (e^V \Phi)
\\
\overline\nabla\overline\nabla \Phi^* &amp;\equiv&amp; {\overline D}{\overline D}(\Phi^*e^{V} ) e^{-V} \end{eqnarray}\]</span> which each have covariant supergauge transformation rules.</p>
<p>Returning to the globally supersymmetric non-renormalizable theory defined by eq. ([eq:Lnonren]), with no extra derivatives, the part of the Lagrangian coming from the superpotential is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\left [ W(\Phi_i) \right ]_F = W^i F_i  - \frac{1}{2} W^{ij} \psi_i \psi_j ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W^i = \frac{\delta W}{\delta\Phi_i} 
\biggl |_{\Phi_i \rightarrow \phi_i},
\qquad\qquad
W^{ij} = \frac{\delta^{2} W}{\delta\Phi_i\delta \Phi_j}
\biggl |_{\Phi_i \rightarrow \phi_i}
,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the superfields have been replaced by their scalar components after differentiation. [Compare eqs. ([tryint]), ([expresswij]), ([wiwiwi]) and the surrounding discussion.] After integrating out the auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>, the part of the scalar potential coming from the superpotential is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V = W^i W_j^* (K^{-1})_i^j,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K^{-1}\)</span> is the inverse matrix of the Kähler metric: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
K^i_j = \frac{\delta^2 K}{\delta \Phi_i \delta \tilde \Phi^{*j}} \biggl |_{\Phi_i 
\rightarrow \phi_i,\&gt; \tilde \Phi^{*i}
\rightarrow \phi^{*i}}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> More generally, the whole component field Lagrangian after integrating out the auxiliary fields is determined in terms of the functions <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab}\)</span> and their derivatives with respect to the chiral superfields, with the remaining chiral superfields replaced by their scalar components. The complete form of this is straightforward to evaluate, but somewhat complicated. In supergravity, there are additional contributions, some of which are discussed in section [subsec:origins.sugra] below.</p>
<h2 id="r-symmetriesrsymmetry"><span class="header-section-number">4.11</span> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetries[Rsymmetry]</h2>
<p>Some supersymmetric Lagrangians are also invariant under a global <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry. The defining feature of a continuous <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry is that the anti-commuting coordinates <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span> transform under it with charges <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> respectively, so <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\theta \&gt; \rightarrow \&gt; e^{i \alpha} \theta,
\qquad\qquad
\theta^\dagger \&gt; \rightarrow \&gt; e^{-i \alpha} \theta^\dagger
\label{eq:Rtranstheta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> parameterizes the global <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> transformation. It follows that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\hat Q \&gt; \rightarrow \&gt; e^{-i \alpha} \hat Q,
\qquad\qquad
\hat Q^\dagger \&gt; \rightarrow \&gt; e^{i \alpha} \hat Q^\dagger,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which in turn implies that the supersymmetry generators have <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>, and so they do not commute with the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry generator: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
[R, Q] = -Q, \qquad\qquad
[R, Q^\dagger] = Q^\dagger\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus the distinct components within a superfield always have different <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charges.</p>
<p>If the theory is invariant under an <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry, then each superfield <span class="math inline">\(S(x,\theta,\theta^\dagger)\)</span> can be assigned an <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charge, denoted <span class="math inline">\(r_S\)</span>, defined by its transformation rule <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
S(x,\,\theta,\,\theta^\dagger) &amp;\rightarrow&amp; 
e^{i r_S \alpha} S(x,\, e^{-i \alpha} \theta,\, e^{i\alpha}\theta^\dagger).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charge of a product of superfields is the sum of the individual <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charges. For a chiral superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charge <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> components transform with charges <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi -1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi-2\)</span>, respectively: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\phi \rightarrow e^{ir_\Phi\alpha} \phi,\qquad\quad
\psi \rightarrow e^{i(r_\Phi - 1)\alpha} \psi,\qquad\quad
F \rightarrow e^{i(r_\Phi - 2)\alpha} F.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The components of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^*\)</span> carry the opposite charges.</p>
<p>Gauge vector superfields will always have vanishing <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charge, since they are real. It follows that the components that are non-zero in Wess-Zumino gauge transform as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
A^\mu \rightarrow A^\mu,\qquad\quad
\lambda \rightarrow e^{i\alpha} \lambda,\qquad\quad
D \rightarrow D.\qquad\quad
\label{eq:Rchargesvector}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and so have <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> respectively. Therefore, a Majorana gaugino mass term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} M_\lambda \lambda\lambda\)</span>, which will appear when supersymmetry is broken, also always breaks the continuous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry. The superspace integration measures <span class="math inline">\(d^2\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d^2\theta^\dagger\)</span> and the chiral covariant derivatives <span class="math inline">\(D_\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline D}_{\dot\alpha}\)</span> carry <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(+2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> respectively. It follows that the gauge field-strength superfield <span class="math inline">\({\cal W}_\alpha\)</span> carries <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charge <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>. (The <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charges of various objects are collected in Table [table:Rcharges].) It is then not hard to check that all supersymmetric Lagrangian terms found above that involve gauge superfields are automatically and necessarily <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-symmetric, including the couplings to chiral superfields. This is also true of the canonical Kähler potential contribution.</p>

<p>However, the superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W(\Phi_i)\)</span> must carry <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> charge <span class="math inline">\(+2\)</span> in order to conserve the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry, and this is certainly not automatic, and often not true. As a simple toy example, with a single gauge-singlet superfield <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, the allowed renormalizable terms in the superpotential are <span class="math inline">\(W(\Phi) = L \Phi + \frac{M}{2} \Phi^2 + \frac{y}{6} \Phi^3\)</span>. If one wants to impose a continuous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry, then one can have at most one of these terms; <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is allowed only if <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is allowed only if <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is allowed only if <span class="math inline">\(r_\Phi = 2/3\)</span>. The MSSM superpotential does turn out to conserve a global <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry, but it is both anomalous and broken by Majorana gaugino masses and other supersymmetry breaking effects.</p>
<p>Since continuous <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetries do not commute with supersymmetry, and are not conserved in the MSSM after anomalies and supersymmetry breaking effects are included, one might wonder why they are considered at all. Perhaps the most important answer to this involves the role of <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetries in models that break global supersymmetry spontaneously, as will be discussed in section [subsec:origins.Fterm] below. It is also possible to extend the particle content of the MSSM in such a way as to preserve a continuous, non-anomalous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry, but at the cost of introducing Dirac gaugino masses and extra Higgs fields <span class="citation" data-cites="Kribs:2007ac">@Kribs:2007ac</span>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that a superpotential could have a discrete <span class="math inline">\(Z_n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry, which can be obtained by restricting the transformation parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in eqs. ([eq:Rtranstheta])-([eq:Rchargesvector]) to integer multiples of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi/n\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(Z_n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> charges of all fields are then integers modulo <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. However, note that the case <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> is always trivial, in the sense that any <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry is exactly equivalent to a corresponding ordinary (non-<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> symmetry under which all components of each supermultiplet transform the same way. This is because when <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is an integer multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, then both <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^\dagger\)</span> always just transform by changing sign, which means that fermionic fields just change sign relative to their bosonic partners. The number of fermionic fields in any Lagrangian term, in any theory, is always even, so the extra sign change for fermionic fields has no effect.</p>
<h1 id="sec:soft"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Soft supersymmetry breaking interactions</h1>
<p>A realistic phenomenological model must contain supersymmetry breaking. From a theoretical perspective, we expect that supersymmetry, if it exists at all, should be an exact symmetry that is broken spontaneously. In other words, the underlying model should have a Lagrangian density that is invariant under supersymmetry, but a vacuum state that is not. In this way, supersymmetry is hidden at low energies in a manner analogous to the fate of the electroweak symmetry in the ordinary Standard Model.</p>
<p>Many models of spontaneous symmetry breaking have indeed been proposed and we will mention the basic ideas of some of them in section [sec:origins]. These always involve extending the MSSM to include new particles and interactions at very high mass scales, and there is no consensus on exactly how this should be done. However, from a practical point of view, it is extremely useful to simply parameterize our ignorance of these issues by just introducing extra terms that break supersymmetry explicitly in the effective MSSM Lagrangian. As was argued in the Introduction, the supersymmetry-breaking couplings should be soft (of positive mass dimension) in order to be able to naturally maintain a hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck (or any other very large) mass scale. This means in particular that dimensionless supersymmetry-breaking couplings should be absent.</p>
<p>The possible soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in the Lagrangian of a general theory are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\! &amp;=&amp; \!
-\left (
{{1\over 2}}M_a\, \lambda^a\lambda^a

-{1\over 2}c_i^{jk} \phi^{*i}\phi_j\phi_k + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\label{lagrsoftprime}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> They consist of gaugino masses <span class="math inline">\(M_a\)</span> for each gauge group, scalar squared-mass terms <span class="math inline">\((m^2)_i^j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b^{ij}\)</span>, and (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings <span class="math inline">\(a^{ijk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_i^{jk}\)</span>, and “tadpole” couplings <span class="math inline">\(t^i\)</span>. The last of these requires <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> to be a gauge singlet, and so <span class="math inline">\(t^i\)</span> does not occur in the MSSM. One might wonder why we have not included possible soft mass terms for the chiral supermultiplet fermions, like <span class="math inline">\({\cal L} = -{{1\over 2}}m^{ij} \psi_i \psi_j + {\rm c.c.}\)</span>  Including such terms would be redundant; they can always be absorbed into a redefinition of the superpotential and the terms <span class="math inline">\((m^2)_j^{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_i^{jk}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It has been shown rigorously that a softly broken supersymmetric theory with <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span> as given by eq. ([lagrsoft]) is indeed free of quadratic divergences in quantum corrections to scalar masses, to all orders in perturbation theory <span class="citation" data-cites="softterms">@softterms</span>. The situation is slightly more subtle if one tries to include the non-holomorphic (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{{\rm maybe}\&gt;\,{\rm soft}}\)</span>. If any of the chiral supermultiplets in the theory are singlets under all gauge symmetries, then non-zero <span class="math inline">\(c_i^{jk}\)</span> terms can lead to quadratic divergences, despite the fact that they are formally soft. Now, this constraint need not apply to the MSSM, which does not have any gauge-singlet chiral supermultiplets. Nevertheless, the possibility of <span class="math inline">\(c_i^{jk}\)</span> terms is nearly always neglected. The real reason for this is that it is difficult to construct models of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in which the <span class="math inline">\(c_i^{jk}\)</span> are not negligibly small. In the special case of a theory that has chiral supermultiplets that are singlets or in the adjoint representation of a simple factor of the gauge group, then there are also possible soft supersymmetry-breaking Dirac mass terms between the corresponding fermions <span class="math inline">\(\psi_a\)</span> and the gauginos <span class="citation" data-cites="Polchinski:1982an">@Polchinski:1982an</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Fox:2002bu">@Fox:2002bu</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L} \,=\,  -M_{\rm Dirac}^a \lambda^a \psi_a + {\rm c.c.}
\label{eq:Diracgauginos}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is not relevant for the MSSM with minimal field content, which does not have adjoint representation chiral supermultiplets. Therefore, equation ([lagrsoft]) is usually taken to be the general form of the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian. For some interesting exceptions, see refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="Polchinski:1982an">@Polchinski:1982an</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Plehn:2008ae">@Plehn:2008ae</span>.</p>
<p>The terms in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span> clearly do break supersymmetry, because they involve only scalars and gauginos and not their respective superpartners. In fact, the soft terms in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}\)</span> are capable of giving masses to all of the scalars and gauginos in a theory, even if the gauge bosons and fermions in chiral supermultiplets are massless (or relatively light). The gaugino masses <span class="math inline">\(M_a\)</span> are always allowed by gauge symmetry. The <span class="math inline">\((m^2)_j^i\)</span> terms are allowed for <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{j*}\)</span> transform in complex conjugate representations of each other under all gauge symmetries; in particular this is true of course when <span class="math inline">\(i=j\)</span>, so every scalar is eligible to get a mass in this way if supersymmetry is broken. The remaining soft terms may or may not be allowed by the symmetries. The <span class="math inline">\(a^{ijk}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b^{ij}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t^i\)</span> terms have the same form as the <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M^{ij}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L^i\)</span> terms in the superpotential [compare eq. ([lagrsoft]) to eq. ([superpotentialwithlinear]) or eq. ([superpot])], so they will each be allowed by gauge invariance if and only if a corresponding superpotential term is allowed.</p>
<p>The Feynman diagram interactions corresponding to the allowed soft terms in eq. ([lagrsoft]) are shown in Figure [fig:soft].</p>

<p>For each of the interactions in Figures [fig:soft]a,c,d there is another with all arrows reversed, corresponding to the complex conjugate term in the Lagrangian. We will apply these general results to the specific case of the MSSM in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="sec:mssm"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</h1>
<p>In sections [sec:susylagr] and [sec:soft], we have found a general recipe for constructing Lagrangians for softly broken supersymmetric theories. We are now ready to apply these general results to the MSSM. The particle content for the MSSM was described in the Introduction. In this section we will complete the model by specifying the superpotential and the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:mssm.superpotential"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> The superpotential and supersymmetric interactions</h2>
<p>The superpotential for the MSSM is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W_{\rm MSSM} =
{\overline}u {\bf y_u} Q H_u -
{\overline}d {\bf y_d} Q H_d -
{\overline}e {\bf y_e} L H_d +
\mu H_u H_d \&gt; .
\label{MSSMsuperpot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The objects <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e\)</span> appearing here are chiral superfields corresponding to the chiral supermultiplets in Table [tab:chiral]. (Alternatively, they can be just thought of as the corresponding scalar fields, as was done in section [sec:susylagr], but we prefer not to put the tildes on <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e\)</span> in order to reduce clutter.) The dimensionless Yukawa coupling parameters <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_u}, {\bf y_d}, {\bf y_e}\)</span> are 3<span class="math inline">\(\times 3\)</span> matrices in family space. All of the gauge [<span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> color and <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> weak isospin] and family indices in eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) are suppressed. The “<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term”, as it is traditionally called, can be written out as <span class="math inline">\(\mu (H_u)_\alpha (H_d)_\beta \epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\)</span> is used to tie together <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> weak isospin indices <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta=1,2\)</span> in a gauge-invariant way. Likewise, the term <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u {\bf y_u} Q H_u\)</span> can be written out as <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u^{ia}\, {({\bf y_u})_i}^j\, Q_{j\alpha a}\, (H_u)_\beta \epsilon^{\alpha \beta}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2,3\)</span> is a family index, and <span class="math inline">\(a=1,2,3\)</span> is a color index which is lowered (raised) in the <span class="math inline">\(\bf 3\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\bf \overline 3\)</span>) representation of <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term in eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) is the supersymmetric version of the Higgs boson mass in the Standard Model. It is unique, because terms <span class="math inline">\(H_u^* H_u\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_d^* H_d\)</span> are forbidden in the superpotential, which must be holomorphic in the chiral superfields (or equivalently in the scalar fields) treated as complex variables, as shown in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral]. We can also see from the form of eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) why both <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> are needed in order to give Yukawa couplings, and thus masses, to all of the quarks and leptons. Since the superpotential must be holomorphic, the ${}u Q H_u $ Yukawa terms cannot be replaced by something like <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u Q H_d^*\)</span>. Similarly, the <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d Q H_d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e L H_d\)</span> terms cannot be replaced by something like <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d Q H_u^*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e L H_u^*\)</span>. The analogous Yukawa couplings would be allowed in a general non-supersymmetric two Higgs doublet model, but are forbidden by the structure of supersymmetry. So we need both <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span>, even without invoking the argument based on anomaly cancellation mentioned in the Introduction.</p>
<p>The Yukawa matrices determine the current masses and CKM mixing angles of the ordinary quarks and leptons, after the neutral scalar components of <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> get VEVs. Since the top quark, bottom quark and tau lepton are the heaviest fermions in the Standard Model, it is often useful to make an approximation that only the <span class="math inline">\((3,3)\)</span> family components of each of <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_u}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_d}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_e}\)</span> are important: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf y_u} \approx \pmatrix{0&amp;0&amp;0\cr 0&amp;0&amp;0 \cr 0&amp;0&amp;y_t},\qquad
{\bf y_d} \approx \pmatrix{0&amp;0&amp;0\cr 0&amp;0&amp;0 \cr 0&amp;0&amp;y_b},\qquad
{\bf y_e} \approx \pmatrix{0&amp;0&amp;0\cr 0&amp;0&amp;0 \cr 0&amp;0&amp;y_\tau}.\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{heavytopapprox}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In this limit, only the third family and Higgs fields contribute to the MSSM superpotential. It is instructive to write the superpotential in terms of the separate <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> weak isospin components [<span class="math inline">\(Q_3 = (t\, b)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L_3 = (\nu_\tau\, \tau)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_u = (H_u^+\, H_u^0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_d = (H_d^0\, H_d^-)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u_3 = {\overline}t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}d_3 = {\overline}b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e_3 = {\overline}\tau\)</span>], so: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W_{\rm MSSM}\! &amp;\approx &amp; \!
y_t ({\overline}t t H_u^0 - {\overline}t b H_u^+) -
y_b ({\overline}b t H_d^- - {\overline}b b H_d^0) -
y_\tau ({\overline}\tau \nu_\tau H_d^- - {\overline}\tau \tau H_d^0)
\&gt; \nonumber \\
&amp;&amp; +
\mu (H_u^+ H_d^- - H_u^0 H_d^0).
\label{Wthird}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The minus signs inside the parentheses appear because of the antisymmetry of the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\)</span> symbol used to tie up the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> indices. The other minus signs in eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) were chosen (as a convention) so that the terms <span class="math inline">\(y_t {\overline}t t H_u^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_b {\overline}b b H_d^0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau {\overline}\tau \tau H_d^0\)</span>, which will become the top, bottom and tau masses when <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span> get VEVs, each have overall positive signs in eq. ([Wthird]).</p>
<p>Since the Yukawa interactions <span class="math inline">\(y^{ijk}\)</span> in a general supersymmetric theory must be completely symmetric under interchange of <span class="math inline">\(i,j,k\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_u}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_d}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\bf y_e}\)</span> imply not only Higgs-quark-quark and Higgs-lepton-lepton couplings as in the Standard Model, but also squark-Higgsino-quark and slepton-Higgsino-lepton interactions. To illustrate this, Figures <span>[fig:topYukawa]</span>a,b,c show some of the interactions involving the top-quark Yukawa coupling <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>.</p>

<p>Figure [fig:topYukawa]a is the Standard Model-like coupling of the top quark to the neutral complex scalar Higgs boson, which follows from the first term in eq. ([Wthird]). For variety, we have used <span class="math inline">\(t_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_R^\dagger\)</span> in place of their synonyms <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline}t\)</span> (see the discussion near the end of section [sec:notations]). In Figure [fig:topYukawa]b, we have the coupling of the left-handed top squark <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L\)</span> to the neutral higgsino field <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}H}_u^0\)</span> and right-handed top quark, while in Figure [fig:topYukawa]c the right-handed top anti-squark field (known either as <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}{{\overline}t}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R^*\)</span> depending on taste) couples to <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}H}^0_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_L\)</span>. For each of the three interactions, there is another with <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\rightarrow H_u^+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_L \rightarrow -b_L\)</span> (with tildes where appropriate), corresponding to the second part of the first term in eq. ([Wthird]). All of these interactions are required by supersymmetry to have the same strength <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>. These couplings are dimensionless and can be modified by the introduction of soft supersymmetry breaking only through finite (and small) radiative corrections, so this equality of interaction strengths is also a prediction of softly broken supersymmetry. A useful mnemonic is that each of Figures <span>[fig:topYukawa]</span>a,b,c can be obtained from any of the others by changing two of the particles into their superpartners.</p>
<p>There are also scalar quartic interactions with strength proportional to <span class="math inline">\(y_t^2\)</span>, as can be seen from Figure [fig:dim0]c or the last term in eq. ([ordpot]). Three of them are shown in Figure <span>[fig:stop]</span>.</p>

<p>Using eq. ([ordpot]) and eq. ([Wthird]), one can see that there are five more, which can be obtained by replacing <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L \rightarrow {\widetilde}b_L\)</span> and/or <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0 \rightarrow H_u^+\)</span> in each vertex. This illustrates the remarkable economy of supersymmetry; there are many interactions determined by only a single parameter. In a similar way, the existence of all the other quark and lepton Yukawa couplings in the superpotential eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) leads not only to Higgs-quark-quark and Higgs-lepton-lepton Lagrangian terms as in the ordinary Standard Model, but also to squark-higgsino-quark and slepton-higgsino-lepton terms, and scalar quartic couplings [(squark)<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span>, (slepton)<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span>, (squark)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>(slepton)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, (squark)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>(Higgs)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, and (slepton)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>(Higgs)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>]. If needed, these can all be obtained in terms of the Yukawa matrices <span class="math inline">\(\bf y_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf y_d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\bf y_e\)</span> as outlined above.</p>
<p>However, the dimensionless interactions determined by the superpotential are usually not the most important ones of direct interest for phenomenology. This is because the Yukawa couplings are already known to be very small, except for those of the third family (top, bottom, tau). Instead, production and decay processes for superpartners in the MSSM are typically dominated by the supersymmetric interactions of gauge-coupling strength, as we will explore in more detail in sections [sec:decays] and [sec:signals]. The couplings of the Standard Model gauge bosons (photon, <span class="math inline">\(W^\pm\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span> and gluons) to the MSSM particles are determined completely by the gauge invariance of the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The gauginos also couple to (squark, quark) and (slepton, lepton) and (Higgs, higgsino) pairs as illustrated in the general case in Figure [fig:gauge]g,h and the first two terms in the second line in eq. ([gensusylagr]). For instance, each of the squark-quark-gluino couplings is given by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} g_3 ({\widetilde}q \, T^{a} q {\widetilde}g + {{{\rm c.c.}}})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T^a = \lambda^a/2\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(a=1\ldots 8\)</span>) are the matrix generators for <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span>.

<p>In Figures [fig:gaugino]b,c we show in a similar way the couplings of (squark, quark), (lepton, slepton) and (Higgs, higgsino) pairs to the winos and bino, with strengths proportional to the electroweak gauge couplings <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^\prime\)</span> respectively. For each of these diagrams, there is another with all arrows reversed. Note that the winos only couple to the left-handed squarks and sleptons, and the (lepton, slepton) and (Higgs, higgsino) pairs of course do not couple to the gluino. The bino coupling to each (scalar, fermion) pair is also proportional to the weak hypercharge <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as given in Table [tab:chiral]. The interactions shown in Figure [fig:gaugino] provide, for example, for decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow q{\widetilde}g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow {\widetilde}W q^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow {\widetilde}B q\)</span> when the final states are kinematically allowed to be on-shell. However, a complication is that the <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B\)</span> states are not mass eigenstates, because of splitting and mixing due to electroweak symmetry breaking, as we will see in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.inos].</p>
<p>There are also various scalar quartic interactions in the MSSM that are uniquely determined by gauge invariance and supersymmetry, according to the last term in eq. ([fdpot]), as illustrated in Figure [fig:gauge]i. Among them are (Higgs)<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span> terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(g^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^{\prime 2}\)</span> in the scalar potential. These are the direct generalization of the last term in the Standard Model Higgs potential, eq. ([higgspotential]), to the case of the MSSM. We will have occasion to identify them explicitly when we discuss the minimization of the MSSM Higgs potential in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs].</p>
<p>The dimensionful couplings in the supersymmetric part of the MSSM Lagrangian are all dependent on <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Using the general result of eq. ([lagrchiral]), <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> provides for higgsino fermion mass terms <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
-{{\cal L}}_{\mbox{higgsino mass}}= \mu ({\widetilde}H_u^+ {\widetilde}H_d^- - {\widetilde}H_u^0 {\widetilde}H_d^0)+ {{{\rm c.c.}}},
\label{poody}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> as well as Higgs squared-mass terms in the scalar potential <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
-{{\cal L}}_{\mbox{supersymmetric Higgs mass}} \,=\, |\mu|^2 
\bigl 
(
|H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2 + |H_d^0|^2 + |H_d^-|^2 \bigr ).
\label{movie}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Since eq. ([movie]) is non-negative with a minimum at <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0 = H_d^0 = 0\)</span>, we cannot understand electroweak symmetry breaking without including a negative supersymmetry-breaking squared-mass soft term for the Higgs scalars. An explicit treatment of the Higgs scalar potential will therefore have to wait until we have introduced the soft terms for the MSSM. However, we can already see a puzzle: we expect that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> should be roughly of order <span class="math inline">\(10^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(10^3\)</span> GeV, in order to allow a Higgs VEV of order 174 GeV without too much miraculous cancellation between <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2\)</span> and the negative soft squared-mass terms that we have not written down yet. But why should <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2\)</span> be so small compared to, say, <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}^2\)</span>, and in particular why should it be roughly of the same order as <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\rm soft}\)</span>? The scalar potential of the MSSM seems to depend on two types of dimensionful parameters that are conceptually quite distinct, namely the supersymmetry-respecting mass <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the supersymmetry-breaking soft mass terms. Yet the observed value for the electroweak breaking scale suggests that without miraculous cancellations, both of these apparently unrelated mass scales should be within an order of magnitude or so of 100 GeV. This puzzle is called “the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem”. Several different solutions to the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem have been proposed, involving extensions of the MSSM of varying intricacy. They all work in roughly the same way; the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term is required or assumed to be absent at tree-level before symmetry breaking, and then it arises from the VEV(s) of some new field(s). These VEVs are in turn determined by minimizing a potential that depends on soft supersymmetry-breaking terms. In this way, the value of the effective parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is no longer conceptually distinct from the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking; if we can explain why <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft} \ll {M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, we will also be able to understand why <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is of the same order. In sections [subsec:variations.NMSSM] and [subsec:variations.munonrenorm] we will study three such mechanisms: the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the Kim-Nilles mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="KimNilles">@KimNilles</span>, and the Giudice-Masiero mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="GiudiceMasiero">@GiudiceMasiero</span>. Another solution based on loop effects was proposed in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="muproblemGMSB">@muproblemGMSB</span>. From the point of view of the MSSM, however, we can just treat <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as an independent parameter, without committing to a specific mechanism.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>-term and the Yukawa couplings in the superpotential eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) combine to yield (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings [see the second and third terms on the right-hand side of eq. ([ordpot])] of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>The superpotential eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) is minimal in the sense that it is sufficient to produce a phenomenologically viable model. However, there are other terms that one can write that are gauge-invariant and holomorphic in the chiral superfields, but are not included in the MSSM because they violate either baryon number (<span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span>) or total lepton number (<span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span>). The most general gauge-invariant and renormalizable superpotential would include not only eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]), but also the terms <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W_{\Delta {\rm L} =1} &amp;=&amp;
{1\over 2} \lambda^{ijk} L_iL_j{{\overline}e_k}

\label{WLviol} \\

{{\overline}u_i}{{\overline}d_j}{{\overline}d_k}
\label{WBviol}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where family indices <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2,3\)</span> have been restored. The chiral supermultiplets carry baryon number assignments <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}=+1/3\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}=-1/3\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\({\overline}u_i, {\overline}d_i\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}=0\)</span> for all others. The total lepton number assignments are <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}=+1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}=-1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\({\overline}e_i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}=0\)</span> for all others. Therefore, the terms in eq. ([WLviol]) violate total lepton number by 1 unit (as well as the individual lepton flavors) and those in eq. ([WBviol]) violate baryon number by 1 unit.</p>
<p>The possible existence of such terms might seem rather disturbing, since corresponding <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span>-violating processes have not been seen experimentally. The most obvious experimental constraint comes from the non-observation of proton decay, which would violate both <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span> by 1 unit. If both <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\prime\prime}\)</span> couplings were present and unsuppressed, then the lifetime of the proton would be extremely short.

In contrast, the decay time of the proton into lepton+meson final states is known experimentally to be in excess of <span class="math inline">\(10^{32}\)</span> years. Therefore, at least one of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\prime ijk}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\prime\prime 11k}\)</span> for each of <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(j=1,2\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(k=2,3\)</span> must be extremely small. Many other processes also give strong constraints on the violation of lepton and baryon numbers <span class="citation" data-cites="rparityconstraints RPVreviews">@rparityconstraints [@RPVreviews]</span>.</p>
<p>One could simply try to take <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span> conservation as a postulate in the MSSM. However, this is clearly a step backward from the situation in the Standard Model, where the conservation of these quantum numbers is <span><em>not</em></span> assumed, but is rather a pleasantly “accidental” consequence of the fact that there are no possible renormalizable Lagrangian terms that violate <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span>. Furthermore, there is a quite general obstacle to treating <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span> as fundamental symmetries of Nature, since they are known to be necessarily violated by non-perturbative electroweak effects <span class="citation" data-cites="tHooft">@tHooft</span> (even though those effects are calculably negligible for experiments at ordinary energies). Therefore, in the MSSM one adds a new symmetry, which has the effect of eliminating the possibility of <span class="math inline">\({{\rm B}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm L}}\)</span> violating terms in the renormalizable superpotential, while allowing the good terms in eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]). This new symmetry is called “<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity” <span class="citation" data-cites="Rparity">@Rparity</span> or equivalently “matter parity” <span class="citation" data-cites="matterparity">@matterparity</span>.</p>
<p>Matter parity is a multiplicatively conserved quantum number defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
P_M = (-1)^{3 ({{\rm B}}-{{\rm L}})}
\label{defmatterparity}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> for each particle in the theory. It follows that the quark and lepton supermultiplets all have <span class="math inline">\(P_M=-1\)</span>, while the Higgs supermultiplets <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(P_M=+1\)</span>. The gauge bosons and gauginos of course do not carry baryon number or lepton number, so they are assigned matter parity <span class="math inline">\(P_M=+1\)</span>. The symmetry principle to be enforced is that a candidate term in the Lagrangian (or in the superpotential) is allowed only if the product of <span class="math inline">\(P_M\)</span> for all of the fields in it is <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>. It is easy to see that each of the terms in eqs. ([WLviol]) and ([WBviol]) is thus forbidden, while the good and necessary terms in eq. ([MSSMsuperpot]) are allowed. This discrete symmetry commutes with supersymmetry, as all members of a given supermultiplet have the same matter parity. The advantage of matter parity is that it can in principle be an <span><em>exact</em></span> and fundamental symmetry, which B and L themselves cannot, since they are known to be violated by non-perturbative electroweak effects. So even with exact matter parity conservation in the MSSM, one expects that baryon number and total lepton number violation can occur in tiny amounts, due to non-renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian. However, the MSSM does not have renormalizable interactions that violate B or L, with the standard assumption of matter parity conservation.</p>
<p>It is often useful to recast matter parity in terms of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity, defined for each particle as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
P_R = (-1)^{3({{\rm B}}-{{\rm L}}) + 2 s}
\label{defRparity}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the spin of the particle. Now, matter parity conservation and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity conservation are precisely equivalent, since the product of <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{2s}\)</span> for the particles involved in any interaction vertex in a theory that conserves angular momentum is always equal to <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>. However, particles within the same supermultiplet do not have the same <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity. In general, symmetries with the property that fields within the same supermultiplet have different transformations are called <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetries; they do not commute with supersymmetry. Continuous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetries were described in section [Rsymmetry], and are often encountered in the model-building literature; they should not be confused with <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity, which is a discrete <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> symmetry. In fact, the matter parity version of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity makes clear that there is really nothing intrinsically “<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>” about it; in other words it secretly does commute with supersymmetry, so its name is somewhat suboptimal. Nevertheless, the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity assignment is very useful for phenomenology because all of the Standard Model particles and the Higgs bosons have even <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity (<span class="math inline">\(P_R=+1\)</span>), while all of the squarks, sleptons, gauginos, and higgsinos have odd <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity (<span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span>).</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity odd particles are known as “supersymmetric particles” or “sparticles” for short, and they are distinguished by a tilde (see Tables [tab:chiral] and [tab:gauge]). If <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is exactly conserved, then there can be no mixing between the sparticles and the <span class="math inline">\(P_R=+1\)</span> particles. Furthermore, every interaction vertex in the theory contains an even number of <span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span> sparticles. This has three extremely important phenomenological consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The lightest sparticle with <span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span>, called the “lightest supersymmetric particle” or LSP, must be absolutely stable. If the LSP is electrically neutral, it interacts only weakly with ordinary matter, and so can make an attractive candidate <span class="citation" data-cites="neutralinodarkmatter">@neutralinodarkmatter</span> for the non-baryonic dark matter that seems to be required by cosmology.</p></li>
<li><p>Each sparticle other than the LSP must eventually decay into a state that contains an odd number of LSPs (usually just one).</p></li>
<li><p>In collider experiments, sparticles can only be produced in even numbers (usually two-at-a-time).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We <span><em>define</em></span> the MSSM to conserve <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity or equivalently matter parity. While this decision seems to be well-motivated phenomenologically by proton decay constraints and the hope that the LSP will provide a good dark matter candidate, it might appear somewhat artificial from a theoretical point of view. After all, the MSSM would not suffer any internal inconsistency if we did not impose matter parity conservation. Furthermore, it is fair to ask why matter parity should be exactly conserved, given that the discrete symmetries in the Standard Model (ordinary parity <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, charge conjugation <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, time reversal <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, etc.) are all known to be inexact symmetries. Fortunately, it <span><em>is</em></span> sensible to formulate matter parity as a discrete symmetry that is exactly conserved. In general, exactly conserved, or “gauged” discrete symmetries <span class="citation" data-cites="KW">@KW</span> can exist provided that they satisfy certain anomaly cancellation conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="discreteanomaly">@discreteanomaly</span> (much like continuous gauged symmetries). One particularly attractive way this could occur is if B<span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>L is a continuous gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken at some very high energy scale. A continuous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_{{{\rm B}}-{{\rm L}}}\)</span> forbids the renormalizable terms that violate B and L <span class="citation" data-cites="Rparityoriginone Rparityorigintwo">@Rparityoriginone [@Rparityorigintwo]</span>, but this gauge symmetry must be spontaneously broken, since there is no corresponding massless vector boson. However, if gauged <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_{{{\rm B}}- {{\rm L}}}\)</span> is only broken by scalar VEVs (or other order parameters) that carry even integer values of <span class="math inline">\(3(\)</span>B<span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>L<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(P_M\)</span> will automatically survive as an exactly conserved discrete remnant subgroup <span class="citation" data-cites="Rparityorigintwo">@Rparityorigintwo</span>. A variety of extensions of the MSSM in which exact <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity conservation is guaranteed in just this way have been proposed (see for example <span class="citation" data-cites="Rparityorigintwo Rparityoriginthree">@Rparityorigintwo [@Rparityoriginthree]</span>).</p>
<p>It may also be possible to have gauged discrete symmetries that do not owe their exact conservation to an underlying continuous gauged symmetry, but rather to some other structure such as can occur in string theory. It is also possible that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is broken, or is replaced by some alternative discrete symmetry. We will briefly consider these as variations on the MSSM in section [subsec:variations.RPV].</p>

Each of <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{ Q}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{{{\overline}u}}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{{{\overline}d}}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{L}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{{{\overline}e}}}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> matrix in family space that can have complex entries, but they must be hermitian so that the Lagrangian is real. (To avoid clutter, we do not put tildes on the <span class="math inline">\(\bf Q\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\bf m^2_Q\)</span>, etc.) Finally, in the last line of eq. ([MSSMsoft]) we have supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs potential; <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2\)</span> are squared-mass terms of the <span class="math inline">\((m^2)_i^j\)</span> type, while <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the only squared-mass term of the type <span class="math inline">\(b^{ij}\)</span> in eq. ([lagrsoft]) that can occur in the MSSM.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> As argued in the Introduction, we expect <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

The expression eq. ([MSSMsoft]) is the most general soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian of the form eq. ([lagrsoft]) that is compatible with gauge invariance and matter parity conservation in the MSSM.</p>
<p>Unlike the supersymmetry-preserving part of the Lagrangian, the above <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}^{\rm MSSM}\)</span> introduces many new parameters that were not present in the ordinary Standard Model. A careful count <span class="citation" data-cites="dimsut">@dimsut</span> reveals that there are 105 masses, phases and mixing angles in the MSSM Lagrangian that cannot be rotated away by redefining the phases and flavor basis for the quark and lepton supermultiplets, and that have no counterpart in the ordinary Standard Model. Thus, in principle, supersymmetry <span><em>breaking</em></span> (as opposed to supersymmetry itself) appears to introduce a tremendous arbitrariness in the Lagrangian.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:mssm.hints"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Hints of an Organizing Principle</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there is already good experimental evidence that some powerful organizing principle must govern the soft supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian. This is because most of the new parameters in eq. ([MSSMsoft]) imply flavor mixing or CP violating processes of the types that are severely restricted by experiment <span class="citation" data-cites="FCNCs">@FCNCs</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ciuchini:2002uv">@Ciuchini:2002uv</span>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\bf m_{{\overline}e}^2\)</span> is not diagonal in the basis <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}e_R, {\widetilde}\mu_R, {\widetilde}\tau_R)\)</span> of sleptons whose superpartners are the right-handed parts of the Standard Model mass eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(e,\mu,\tau\)</span>. In that case, slepton mixing occurs, so the individual lepton numbers will not be conserved, even for processes that only involve the sleptons as virtual particles. A particularly strong limit on this possibility comes from the experimental bound on the process <span class="math inline">\(\mu\rightarrow e \gamma\)</span>, which could arise from the one-loop diagram shown in Figure [fig:flavormuegamma]a. The symbol “<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>” on the slepton line represents an insertion coming from <span class="math inline">\(-({\bf m^2_{{\overline}e}})_{21}{\widetilde}\mu^*_R{\widetilde}e_R\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}^{\rm MSSM}\)</span>, and the slepton-bino vertices are determined by the weak hypercharge gauge coupling [see Figures [fig:gauge]g,h and eq. ([gensusylagr])].</p>

\label{eq:muegamma}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where it is assumed for simplicity that both <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \mu_R\)</span> are nearly mass eigenstates with almost degenerate squared masses <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\tilde \ell_R}\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\tilde \mu_R^* \tilde e_R} \equiv ({\bf m^2_{{\overline}e}})_{21} = [({\bf m^2_{{\overline}e}})_{12}]^*\)</span> can be treated as a perturbation, and that the bino <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B\)</span> is nearly a mass eigenstate. This result is to be compared to the present experimental upper limit <span class="math inline">\({{\rm Br}}(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma)_{\rm exp} &lt; 5.7\times 10^{-13}\)</span> from <span class="citation" data-cites="muegammaexperiment">@muegammaexperiment</span>. So, if the right-handed slepton squared-mass matrix <span class="math inline">\({\bf m^2_{{\overline}e}}\)</span> were “random”, with all entries of comparable size, then the prediction for <span class="math inline">\({{\rm Br}}(\mu\rightarrow e\gamma)\)</span> would be too large even if the sleptons and bino masses were at 1 TeV. For lighter superpartners, the constraint on <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \mu_R, \tilde e_R\)</span> squared-mass mixing becomes correspondingly more severe. There are also contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma\)</span> that depend on the off-diagonal elements of the left-handed slepton squared-mass matrix <span class="math inline">\(\bf m^2_L\)</span>, coming from the diagram shown in fig. [fig:flavormuegamma]b involving the charged wino and the sneutrinos, as well as diagrams just like fig. [fig:flavormuegamma]a but with left-handed sleptons and either <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^0\)</span> exchanged. Therefore, the slepton squared-mass matrices must not have significant mixings for <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L,{\widetilde}\mu_L\)</span> either.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Higgs scalars get VEVs, the <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_e\)</span> matrix could imply squared-mass terms that mix left-handed and right-handed sleptons with different lepton flavors. For example, <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}^{\rm MSSM}\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}{{\overline}e}} {\bf a_e} {{\widetilde}L} H_d + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\)</span> which implies terms $ -H_d^0 ({})_{12} {}e_R^* {}<em>L -H_d^0 ({})</em>{21} {}_R^* {}e_L + {{{}}}$  These also contribute to <span class="math inline">\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma\)</span>, as illustrated in fig. [fig:flavormuegamma]c. So the magnitudes of <span class="math inline">\(({\bf a_e})_{12}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(({\bf a_e})_{21}\)</span> are also constrained by experiment to be small, but in a way that is more strongly dependent on other model parameters <span class="citation" data-cites="muegammatwo">@muegammatwo</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(({\bf a_e})_{13}, ({\bf a_e})_{31}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(({\bf a_e})_{23}, ({\bf a_e})_{32}\)</span> are constrained, although more weakly <span class="citation" data-cites="flavorreview">@flavorreview</span>, by the experimental limits on <span class="math inline">\({{\rm Br}}(\tau \rightarrow e \gamma)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\rm Br}}(\tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma)\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are also important experimental constraints on the squark squared-mass matrices. The strongest of these come from the neutral kaon system. The effective Hamiltonian for <span class="math inline">\(K^0\leftrightarrow \overline K^0\)</span> mixing gets contributions from the diagrams in Figure [fig:flavor], among others, if <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}^{\rm MSSM}\)</span> contains terms that mix down squarks and strange squarks. The gluino-squark-quark vertices in Figure [fig:flavor] are all fixed by supersymmetry to be of QCD interaction strength. (There are similar diagrams in which the bino and winos are exchanged, which can be important depending on the relative sizes of the gaugino masses.) For example, suppose that there is a non-zero right-handed down-squark squared-mass mixing <span class="math inline">\(({\bf m^2_{{\overline}d}})_{21}\)</span> in the basis corresponding to the quark mass eigenstates.</p>

\label{eq:striking}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> An off-diagonal contribution from <span class="math inline">\({\bf a_d}\)</span> would cause flavor mixing between left-handed and right-handed squarks, just as discussed above for sleptons, resulting in a strong constraint from diagrams like fig. [fig:flavor]c. More generally, limits on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m_K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&#39;/\epsilon\)</span> appearing in the neutral kaon effective Hamiltonian severely restrict the amounts of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_{L,R},\,{\widetilde}s_{L,R}\)</span> squark mixings (separately and in various combinations), and associated CP-violating complex phases, that one can tolerate in the soft squared masses.</p>
<p>Weaker, but still interesting, constraints come from the <span class="math inline">\(D^0, \overline D^0\)</span> system, which limits the amounts of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u,{\widetilde}c\)</span> mixings from <span class="math inline">\({\bf m_{{\overline}u}^2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\bf m_Q^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\bf a_u}\)</span>.

More constraints follow from rare <span class="math inline">\(\Delta F=1\)</span> meson decays, notably those involving the parton-level processes <span class="math inline">\(b\rightarrow s\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c \rightarrow u \ell^+ \ell^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s \rightarrow d e^+ e^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s \rightarrow d \nu \bar \nu\)</span>, all of which can be mediated by flavor mixing in soft supersymmetry breaking. There are also strict constraints on CP-violating phases in the gaugino masses and (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> soft couplings following from limits on the electric dipole moments of the neutron and electron <span class="citation" data-cites="demon">@demon</span>. Detailed limits can be found in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="FCNCs">@FCNCs</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ciuchini:2002uv">@Ciuchini:2002uv</span>, but the essential lesson from experiment is that the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian cannot be arbitrary or random.</p>
<p>All of these potentially dangerous flavor-changing and CP-violating effects in the MSSM can be evaded if one assumes (or can explain!) that supersymmetry breaking is suitably “universal”. Consider an idealized limit in which the squark and slepton squared-mass matrices are flavor-blind, each proportional to the <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> identity matrix in family space: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m^2_{Q}} = m^2_{Q} {\bf 1},
\qquad\!\!\!\!
{\bf m^2_{{\overline}u}} = m^2_{{\overline}u} {\bf 1},
\qquad\!\!\!\!
{\bf m^2_{{\overline}d}} = m^2_{{\overline}d} {\bf 1},
\qquad\!\!\!\!
{\bf m^2_{L}} = m^2_{L} {\bf 1},
\qquad\!\!\!\!
{\bf m^2_{{\overline}e}} = m^2_{{\overline}e} {\bf 1}
.\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{scalarmassunification}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Then all squark and slepton mixing angles are rendered trivial, because squarks and sleptons with the same electroweak quantum numbers will be degenerate in mass and can be rotated into each other at will. Supersymmetric contributions to flavor-changing neutral current processes will therefore be very small in such an idealized limit, up to mixing induced by <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_e\)</span>. Making the further assumption that the (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings are each proportional to the corresponding Yukawa coupling matrix, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf a_u} = A_{u0} \,{\bf y_u}, \&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\qquad

\label{aunification}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> will ensure that only the squarks and sleptons of the third family can have large (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings. Finally, one can avoid disastrously large CP-violating effects by assuming that the soft parameters do not introduce new complex phases. This is automatic for <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2\)</span>, and for <span class="math inline">\(m_Q^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\overline}u}^2\)</span>, etc. if eq. ([scalarmassunification]) is assumed; if they were not real numbers, the Lagrangian would not be real. One can also fix <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> in the superpotential and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in eq. ([MSSMsoft]) to be real, by appropriate phase rotations of fermion and scalar components of the <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> supermultiplets. If one then assumes that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Im} (M_1),\, {\rm Im} (M_2),\, {\rm Im} (M_3),\,
{\rm Im} (A_{u0}),\, {\rm Im} (A_{d0}),\, {\rm Im} (A_{e0}) 
\&gt;\&gt; = \&gt;\&gt;
0,
\qquad{}
\label{commonphase}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> then the only CP-violating phase in the theory will be the usual CKM phase found in the ordinary Yukawa couplings. Together, the conditions eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]) make up a rather weak version of what is often called the hypothesis of <span><em>soft supersymmetry-breaking universality</em></span>. The MSSM with these flavor- and CP-preserving relations imposed has far fewer parameters than the most general case. Besides the usual Standard Model gauge and Yukawa coupling parameters, there are 3 independent real gaugino masses, only 5 real squark and slepton squared mass parameters, 3 real scalar cubic coupling parameters, and 4 Higgs mass parameters (one of which can be traded for the known electroweak breaking scale).</p>
<p>There are at least three other possible types of explanations for the suppression of flavor violation in the MSSM that could replace the universality hypothesis of eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]). They can be referred to as the “irrelevancy”, “alignment”, and “<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-symmetry” hypotheses for the soft masses. The “irrelevancy” idea is that the sparticles masses are <span><em>extremely</em></span> heavy, so that their contributions to flavor-changing and CP-violating diagrams like Figures [fig:flavor]a,b are suppressed, as can be seen for example in eqs. ([eq:muegamma])-([eq:striking]). In practice, however, if there is no flavor-blind structure, the degree of suppression needed typically requires <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> much larger than 1 TeV for at least some of the scalar masses. This seems to go directly against the motivation for supersymmetry as a cure for the hierarchy problem as discussed in the Introduction. Nevertheless, it has been argued that this is a sensible possibility <span class="citation" data-cites="Moreminimal splitsusy">@Moreminimal [@splitsusy]</span>. The fact that the LHC searches conducted so far have eliminated many models with lighter squarks anyway tends to make these models seem more attractive. Perhaps a combination of approximate flavor blindness and heavy superpartner masses is the true explanation for the suppression of flavor-violating effects.</p>
<p>The “alignment” idea is that the squark squared-mass matrices do not have the flavor-blindness indicated in eq. ([scalarmassunification]), but are arranged in flavor space to be eqnarray with the relevant Yukawa matrices in just such a way as to avoid large flavor-changing effects <span class="citation" data-cites="cterms alignmentmodels">@cterms [@alignmentmodels]</span>. The alignment models typically require rather special flavor symmetries.</p>
<p>The third possibility is that the theory is (approximately) invariant under a continuous <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry <span class="citation" data-cites="Kribs:2007ac">@Kribs:2007ac</span>. This requires that the MSSM is supplemented, as in <span class="citation" data-cites="Fox:2002bu">@Fox:2002bu</span>, by additional chiral supermultiplets in the adjoint representations of <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span>, as well as an additional pair of Higgs chiral supermultiplets. The gaugino masses in this theory are purely Dirac, of the type in eq. ([eq:Diracgauginos]), and the couplings <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_e\)</span> are absent. This implies a very efficient suppression of flavor-changing effects <span class="citation" data-cites="Kribs:2007ac Blechman:2008gu">@Kribs:2007ac [@Blechman:2008gu]</span>, even if the squark and slepton mass eigenstates are light, non-degenerate, and have large mixings in the basis determined by the Standard Model quark and lepton mass eigenstates. This can lead to unique and intriguing collider signatures <span class="citation" data-cites="Kribs:2007ac Plehn:2008ae">@Kribs:2007ac [@Plehn:2008ae]</span>. However, we will not consider these possibilities further here.</p>
<p>The soft-breaking universality relations eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]), or stronger (more special) versions of them, can be presumed to be the result of some specific model for the origin of supersymmetry breaking, although there is no consensus among theorists as to what the specific model should actually be. In any case, they are indicative of an assumed underlying simplicity or symmetry of the Lagrangian at some very high energy scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span>. If we used this Lagrangian to compute masses and cross-sections and decay rates for experiments at ordinary energies near the electroweak scale, the results would involve large logarithms of order ln<span class="math inline">\((Q_0/m_Z)\)</span> coming from loop diagrams. As is usual in quantum field theory, the large logarithms can be conveniently resummed using renormalization group (RG) equations, by treating the couplings and masses appearing in the Lagrangian as running parameters. Therefore, eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]) should be interpreted as boundary conditions on the running soft parameters at the scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span>, which is likely very far removed from direct experimental probes. We must then RG-evolve all of the soft parameters, the superpotential parameters, and the gauge couplings down to the electroweak scale or comparable scales where humans perform experiments.</p>
<p>At the electroweak scale, eqs. ([scalarmassunification]) and ([aunification]) will no longer hold, even if they were exactly true at the input scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span>. However, to a good approximation, key flavor- and CP-conserving properties remain. This is because, as we will see in section [subsec:RGEs] below, RG corrections due to gauge interactions will respect the form of eqs. ([scalarmassunification]) and ([aunification]), while RG corrections due to Yukawa interactions are quite small except for couplings involving the top, bottom, and tau flavors. Therefore, the (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings and scalar squared-mass mixings should be quite negligible for the squarks and sleptons of the first two families. Furthermore, RG evolution does not introduce new CP-violating phases. Therefore, if universality can be arranged to hold at the input scale, supersymmetric contributions to flavor-changing and CP-violating observables can be acceptably small in comparison to present limits (although quite possibly measurable in future experiments).</p>
<p>One good reason to be optimistic that such a program can succeed is the celebrated apparent unification of gauge couplings in the MSSM <span class="citation" data-cites="gaugeunification">@gaugeunification</span>. The 1-loop RG equations for the Standard Model gauge couplings <span class="math inline">\(g_1, g_2, g_3\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\beta_{g_a} \equiv {d\over dt} g_a =  {1\over 16\pi^2} b_a g_a^3, 
\qquad\quad

\label{mssmg}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t= {\rm ln} (Q/Q_0)\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> the RG scale. The MSSM coefficients are larger because of the extra MSSM particles in loops. The normalization for <span class="math inline">\(g_1\)</span> here is chosen to agree with the canonical covariant derivative for grand unification of the gauge group <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(SO(10)\)</span>.

The quantities <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_a = g_a^2/4\pi\)</span> have the nice property that their reciprocals run linearly with RG scale at one-loop order: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{d\over dt} \alpha_a^{-1} = -{b_a\over 2\pi} \qquad\qquad (a=1,2,3)
\qquad
\label{mssmgrecip}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Figure [fig:gaugeunification] compares the RG evolution of the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_a^{-1}\)</span>, including two-loop effects, in the Standard Model (dashed lines) and the MSSM (solid lines).</p>
<p>[]<span>0.355</span></p>
<p>[]<span>0.64</span></p>
<p>Unlike the Standard Model, the MSSM includes just the right particle content to ensure that the gauge couplings can unify, at a scale <span class="math inline">\(M_U \sim 1.5\times 10^{16}\)</span> GeV. This unification is of course not perfect; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3\)</span> tends to be slightly smaller than the common value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1(M_U) = \alpha_2(M_U)\)</span> at the point where they meet, which is often taken to be the definition of <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>. However, this small difference can easily be ascribed to threshold corrections due to whatever new particles exist near <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span> decreases slightly as the superpartner masses are raised. While the apparent approximate unification of gauge couplings at <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span> might be just an accident, it may also be taken as a strong hint in favor of a grand unified theory (GUT) or superstring models, both of which can naturally accommodate gauge coupling unification below <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. Furthermore, if this hint is taken seriously, then we can reasonably expect to be able to apply a similar RG analysis to the other MSSM couplings and soft masses as well. The next section discusses the form of the necessary RG equations.</p>
<h2 id="renormalization-group-equations-for-the-mssmsubsecrges"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Renormalization Group equations for the MSSM[subsec:RGEs]</h2>
<p>In order to translate a set of predictions at an input scale into physically meaningful quantities that describe physics near the electroweak scale, it is necessary to evolve the gauge couplings, superpotential parameters, and soft terms using their renormalization group (RG) equations. This ensures that the loop expansions for calculations of observables will not suffer from very large logarithms.</p>
<p>As a technical aside, some care is required in choosing regularization and renormalization procedures in supersymmetry. The most popular regularization method for computations of radiative corrections within the Standard Model is dimensional regularization (DREG), in which the number of spacetime dimensions is continued to <span class="math inline">\(d=4-2\epsilon\)</span>. Unfortunately, DREG introduces a spurious violation of supersymmetry, because it has a mismatch between the numbers of gauge boson degrees of freedom and the gaugino degrees of freedom off-shell. This mismatch is only <span class="math inline">\(2\epsilon\)</span>, but can be multiplied by factors up to <span class="math inline">\(1/\epsilon^n\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-loop calculation. In DREG, supersymmetric relations between dimensionless coupling constants (“supersymmetric Ward identities”) are therefore not explicitly respected by radiative corrections involving the finite parts of one-loop graphs and by the divergent parts of two-loop graphs. Instead, one may use the slightly different scheme known as regularization by dimensional reduction, or DRED, which does respect supersymmetry <span class="citation" data-cites="DRED">@DRED</span>. In the DRED method, all momentum integrals are still performed in <span class="math inline">\(d=4-2\epsilon\)</span> dimensions, but the vector index <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> on the gauge boson fields <span class="math inline">\(A^a_\mu\)</span> now runs over all 4 dimensions to maintain the match with the gaugino degrees of freedom. Running couplings are then renormalized using DRED with modified minimal subtraction (<span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm DR}}\)</span>) rather than the usual DREG with modified minimal subtraction (<span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm MS}}\)</span>). In particular, the boundary conditions at the input scale should presumably be applied in a supersymmetry-preserving scheme like <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm DR}}\)</span>. One loop <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-functions are always the same in these two schemes, but it is important to realize that the <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm MS}}\)</span> scheme does violate supersymmetry, so that <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm DR}}\)</span> is preferred<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> from that point of view. (The NSVZ scheme <span class="citation" data-cites="Shifman">@Shifman</span> also respects supersymmetry and has some very useful properties, but with a less obvious connection to calculations of physical observables. It is also possible, but not always very practical, to work consistently within the <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\rm MS}\)</span> scheme, as long as one translates all <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\rm DR}\)</span> couplings and masses into their <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\rm MS}\)</span> counterparts <span class="citation" data-cites="mstodrone">@mstodrone</span><span class="citation" data-cites="mstodrmore">@mstodrmore</span>.)</p>
<p>A general and powerful result known as the <span><em>supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="nonrentheo">@nonrentheo</span> governs the form of the renormalization group equations for supersymmetric theories.

For the parameters appearing in the superpotential eq. ([superpotentialwithlinear]), the implication is that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

It follows that the three ratios <span class="math inline">\(M_a/g_a^2\)</span> are each constant (RG scale independent) up to small two-loop corrections. Since the gauge couplings are observed to unify at <span class="math inline">\(Q = M_U = 1.5 \times 10^{16}\)</span> GeV, it is a popular assumption that the gaugino masses also unify<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> near that scale, with a value called <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>. If so, then it follows that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

Here <span class="math inline">\(g_U\)</span> is the unified gauge coupling at <span class="math inline">\(Q = M_U\)</span>. The hypothesis of eq. ([gauginomassunification]) is particularly powerful because the gaugino mass parameters feed strongly into the RG equations for all of the other soft terms, as we are about to see.</p>

In models obeying eq. ([aunification]), these matrices start off proportional to the corresponding Yukawa couplings at the input scale. The RG evolution respects this property.

<p>Next let us consider the RG equations for the scalar squared masses in the MSSM. In the approximation of eqs. ([heavytopapprox]) and ([heavyatopapprox]), the squarks and sleptons of the first two families have only gauge interactions. This means that if the scalar squared masses satisfy a boundary condition like eq. ([scalarmassunification]) at an input RG scale, then when renormalized to any other RG scale, they will still be almost diagonal, with the approximate form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m_Q^2} \approx \pmatrix{
m_{Q_1}^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\cr

The one-loop RG equations for the first and second family squark and slepton squared masses are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

Also, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:defS}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> An important feature of eq. ([easyscalarrge]) is that the terms on the right-hand sides proportional to gaugino squared masses are negative, so<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the scalar squared-mass parameters grow as they are RG-evolved from the input scale down to the electroweak scale. Even if the scalars have zero or very small masses at the input scale, they can obtain large positive squared masses at the electroweak scale, thanks to the effects of the gaugino masses.</p>
<p>The RG equations for the squared-mass parameters of the Higgs scalars and third-family squarks and sleptons get the same gauge contributions as in eq. ([easyscalarrge]), but they also have contributions due to the large Yukawa (<span class="math inline">\(y_{t,b,\tau}\)</span>) and soft (<span class="math inline">\(a_{t,b,\tau}\)</span>) couplings. At one-loop order, these only appear in three combinations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

If <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is the largest of the Yukawa couplings, as suggested by the experimental fact that the top quark is heavy, then <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> will typically be much larger than <span class="math inline">\(X_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_\tau\)</span>. This can cause the RG-evolved <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> to run negative near the electroweak scale, helping to destabilize the point <span class="math inline">\(H_u = H_d = 0\)</span> and so provoking a Higgs VEV (for a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span>, as we will see in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]), which is just what we want.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Thus a large top Yukawa coupling favors the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry breaking because it induces negative radiative corrections to the Higgs squared mass.</p>

Furthermore, the third-family squark squared masses get a large positive contribution proportional to <span class="math inline">\(|M_3|^2\)</span> from the RG evolution, which the Higgs scalars do not get. These facts make it plausible that the Higgs scalars in the MSSM get VEVs, while the squarks and sleptons, having large positive squared mass, do not.</p>
<p>An examination of the RG equations ([atrge])-([brge]), ([easyscalarrge]), and ([mhurge])-([mstaubarrge]) reveals that if the gaugino mass parameters <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span> are non-zero at the input scale, then all of the other soft terms will be generated too. This implies that models in which gaugino masses dominate over all other effects in the soft supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian at the input scale can be viable. On the other hand, if the gaugino masses were to vanish at tree-level, then they would not get any contributions to their masses at one-loop order; in that case the gauginos would be extremely light and the model would not be phenomenologically acceptable.</p>
<p>Viable models for the origin of supersymmetry breaking typically make predictions for the MSSM soft terms that are refinements of eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]). These predictions can then be used as boundary conditions for the RG equations listed above. In the next section we will study the ideas that go into making such predictions, before turning to their implications for the MSSM spectrum in section [sec:MSSMspectrum].</p>

<h2 id="subsec:origins.general"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> General considerations for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking</h2>
<p>In the MSSM, supersymmetry breaking is simply introduced explicitly. However, we have seen that the soft parameters cannot be arbitrary. In order to understand how patterns like eqs. ([scalarmassunification]), ([aunification]) and ([commonphase]) can emerge, it is necessary to consider models in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. By definition, this means that the vacuum state <span class="math inline">\({|0\rangle}\)</span> is not invariant under supersymmetry transformations, so <span class="math inline">\(Q_\alpha {|0\rangle}\not= 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^\dagger_{\dot{\alpha}}{|0\rangle}\not=0\)</span>. Now, in global supersymmetry, the Hamiltonian operator <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is related to the supersymmetry generators through the algebra eq. ([nonschsusyalg1]): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
H=P^0 =
{1\over 4}( Q_1 Q_{{1}}^\dagger + Q_{{1}}^\dagger Q_1 
+ Q_2 Q_{{2}}^\dagger + Q_{{2}}^\dagger Q_2 ) .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> If supersymmetry is unbroken in the vacuum state, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(H{|0\rangle}= 0\)</span> and the vacuum has zero energy. Conversely, if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum state, then the vacuum must have positive energy, since <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\langle 0|}H {|0\rangle}= {1\over 4} \Bigl (\| Q_1^\dagger {|0\rangle}\|^2 +
\| Q_{{1}} {|0\rangle}\|^2
+ \| Q^\dagger_{2} {|0\rangle}\|^2
+ \| Q_{{2}} {|0\rangle}\|^2
\Bigr ) &gt; 0\end{eqnarray}\]</span> if the Hilbert space is to have positive norm. If spacetime-dependent effects and fermion condensates can be neglected, then <span class="math inline">\({\langle 0|}H{|0\rangle}= {\langle 0|}V {|0\rangle}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the scalar potential in eq. ([fdpot]). Therefore, supersymmetry will be spontaneously broken if the expectation value of <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and/or <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> does not vanish in the vacuum state.</p>
<p>If any state exists in which all <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span> vanish, then it will have zero energy, implying that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken in the true ground state. Conversely, one way to guarantee spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is to look for models in which the equations <span class="math inline">\(F_i=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D^a=0\)</span> cannot all be simultaneously satisfied for <span><em>any</em></span> values of the fields. Then the true ground state necessarily has broken supersymmetry, as does the vacuum state we live in (if it is different). However, another possibility is that the vacuum state in which we live is not the true ground state (which may preserve supersymmetry), but is instead a higher energy metastable supersymmetry-breaking state with lifetime at least of order the present age of the universe <span class="citation" data-cites="Ellis:1982vi">@Ellis:1982vi</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Intriligator:2006dd">@Intriligator:2006dd</span>.

<p>Regardless of whether the vacuum state is stable or metastable, the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry always implies a massless Nambu-Goldstone mode with the same quantum numbers as the broken symmetry generator. In the case of global supersymmetry, the broken generator is the fermionic charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_\alpha\)</span>, so the Nambu-Goldstone particle ought to be a massless neutral Weyl fermion, called the <span><em>goldstino</em></span>. To prove it, consider a general supersymmetric model with both gauge and chiral supermultiplets as in section [sec:susylagr]. The fermionic degrees of freedom consist of gauginos (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a\)</span>) and chiral fermions (<span class="math inline">\(\psi_i\)</span>). After some of the scalar fields in the theory obtain VEVs, the fermion mass matrix has the form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m}_{\rm F} =
\pmatrix{
0 &amp; \sqrt{2} g_b  (\langle \phi^{*}\rangle T^b)^i    
\cr
\sqrt{2} g_a  (\langle \phi^{*}\rangle T^a)^j  &amp; \langle W^{ji} \rangle
}
\label{eq:MFwithSSB}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in the <span class="math inline">\((\lambda^a,\,\psi_i)\)</span> basis. [The off-diagonal entries in this matrix come from the first term in the second line of eq. ([gensusylagr]), and the lower right entry can be seen in eq. ([noFlagr]).] Now observe that <span class="math inline">\({\bf m}_{\rm F}\)</span> annihilates the vector <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\widetilde}G} \,=\, \pmatrix{
{\langle D^a \rangle /\sqrt{2}} \cr \langle F_i\rangle }.
\label{explicitgoldstino}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first row of <span class="math inline">\({\bf m}_{\rm F}\)</span> annihilates <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}G\)</span> by virtue of the requirement eq. ([wgaugeinvar]) that the superpotential is gauge invariant, and the second row does so because of the condition $  = 0 , $ which must be satisfied at any local minimum of the scalar potential. Equation ([explicitgoldstino]) is therefore proportional to the goldstino wavefunction; it is non-trivial if and only if at least one of the auxiliary fields has a VEV, breaking supersymmetry. So we have proved that if global supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, then there must be a massless goldstino, and that its components among the various fermions in the theory are just proportional to the corresponding auxiliary field VEVs.</p>
<p>There is also a useful sum rule that governs the tree-level squared masses of particles in theories with spontaneously broken supersymmetry. For a general theory of the type discussed in section [sec:susylagr], the squared masses of the real scalar degrees of freedom are the eigenvalues of the matrix <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m}^2_{\rm S} =
\pmatrix{
W_{jk}^* W^{ik} + g^2_a (T^a \phi)_j (\phi^* T^a)^i -g_a T^{ai}_j D^a
&amp;
W_{ijk}^* W^k + g^2_a (T^a \phi)_i (T^a \phi)_j
\vspace{0.1cm}
\cr
W^{ijk} W_k^* + g^2_a (\phi^* T^a)^i (\phi^* T^a)^j
&amp;
W_{ik}^* W^{jk} + g^2_a (T^a \phi)_i (\phi^* T^a)^j - g_a T^{aj}_i D^a
},\phantom{x}
\label{eq:rescalarmasssq}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which can be obtained from writing the quadratic part of the tree-level potential as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V \,=\, \frac{1}{2} \pmatrix{\phi^{*j} \!\!&amp; \phi_j} {\bf m}^2_{\rm S}
\pmatrix{\phi_{i} \cr \phi^{*i}} .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In eq. ([eq:rescalarmasssq]), <span class="math inline">\(W^{ijk} = \delta^3 W/\delta \phi_i\delta \phi_j\delta \phi_k\)</span>, and the scalar fields are understood to be replaced by their VEVs. It follows that the sum of the real scalar squared-mass eigenvalues is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Tr}({\bf m}^2_{\rm S}) \,=\, 
2 W_{ik}^* W^{ik} + 2 g^2_a C_a (i) \phi^{*i} \phi_i 
-2 g_a {\rm Tr}(T^{a}) D^a ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with the Casimir invariants <span class="math inline">\(C_a(i)\)</span> defined by eq. ([eq:defCasimir]). Meanwhile, the squared masses of the two-component fermions are given by the eigenvalues of <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m}_{\rm F}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm F}\,=\,
\pmatrix{
2 g_a g_b (\phi^* T^a T^b \phi)

\sqrt{2} g_a (\phi^* T^a)^k W_{jk}^*

\phantom{x} W_{jk}^* W^{ik}  + 2 g^2_c (T^c \phi)_j (\phi^* T^c)^i},
\label{eq:fermionmasssquared}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so the sum of the two-component fermion squared masses is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Tr}({\bf m}_{\rm F}^\dagger {\bf m}_{\rm F}) \,=\,

<p>Supersymmetry breaking with a non-zero <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term VEV can occur through the Fayet-Iliopoulos mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="FayetIliopoulos">@FayetIliopoulos</span>. If the gauge symmetry includes a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> factor, then, as noted in section [subsec:superspacelagrabelian], one can introduce a term linear in the auxiliary field of the corresponding gauge supermultiplet, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm FI} \,=\, -\kappa D,
\label{FI}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is a constant with dimensions of [mass]<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. This term is gauge-invariant and supersymmetric by itself. [Note that for a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge symmetry, the supersymmetry transformation <span class="math inline">\(\delta D\)</span> in eq. ([Dtransf]) is a total derivative.] If we include it in the Lagrangian, then <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> may be forced to get a non-zero VEV. To see this, consider the relevant part of the scalar potential from eqs. ([lagrgauge]) and ([gensusylagr]): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V = \kappa D -{1\over 2} D^2 - g D \sum_i q_i |\phi_i|^2 .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here the <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> are the charges of the scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> under the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge group in question. The presence of the Fayet-Iliopoulos term modifies the equation of motion eq. ([solveforD]) to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
D = \kappa - g \sum_i q_i |\phi_i|^2.
\label{booya}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now suppose that the scalar fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> that are charged under the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> all have non-zero superpotential masses <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span>. (Gauge invariance then requires that they come in pairs with opposite charges.) Then the potential will have the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V  = \sum_i |m_i|^2 |\phi_i|^2 +
     {1\over 2} (\kappa -g \sum_i q_i |\phi_i|^2)^2 .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Since this cannot vanish, supersymmetry must be broken; one can check that the minimum always occurs for non-zero <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. For the simplest case in which <span class="math inline">\(|m_i|^2 &gt; g q_i \kappa\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the minimum is realized for all <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D = \kappa\)</span>, with the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge symmetry unbroken. As further evidence that supersymmetry has indeed been spontaneously broken, note that the scalars then have squared masses <span class="math inline">\(|m_i|^2 - g q_i \kappa\)</span>, while their fermion partners have squared masses <span class="math inline">\(|m_i|^2\)</span>. The gaugino remains massless, as can be understood from the fact that it is the goldstino, as argued on general grounds in section [subsec:origins.general].</p>
<p>For non-Abelian gauge groups, the analog of eq. ([FI]) would not be gauge-invariant and is therefore not allowed, so only <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-terms can drive spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the MSSM, one might imagine that the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> term for <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> has a Fayet-Iliopoulos term as the principal source of supersymmetry breaking. Unfortunately, this cannot work, because the squarks and sleptons do not have superpotential mass terms. So, at least some of them would just get non-zero VEVs in order to make eq. ([booya]) vanish. That would break color and/or electromagnetism, but not supersymmetry. Therefore, a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> must be subdominant compared to other sources of supersymmetry breaking in the MSSM, if not absent altogether. One could instead attempt to trigger supersymmetry breaking with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for some other <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge symmetry, which is as yet unknown because it is spontaneously broken at a very high mass scale or because it does not couple to the Standard Model particles. However, if this is the dominant source for supersymmetry breaking, it proves difficult to give appropriate masses to all of the MSSM particles, especially the gauginos. In any case, we will not discuss <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term breaking as the ultimate origin of supersymmetry violation any further (although it may not be ruled out <span class="citation" data-cites="dtermbreakingmaywork">@dtermbreakingmaywork</span>).</p>

However, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_1\)</span> have different reasons for being massless.

Expanding <span class="math inline">\(V_{\rm 1-loop}\)</span> to first order in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, one finds that the complex scalar <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> receives a positive-definite squared mass equal to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>The O’Raifeartaigh superpotential eq. ([oraif]) yields a Lagrangian that is invariant under a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry (see section [Rsymmetry]) with charge assignments <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
r_{\Phi_1} \,=\, r_{\Phi_2} \,=\, 2,\qquad
r_{\Phi_3} \,=\, 0.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This illustrates a general result, the Nelson-Seiberg theorem <span class="citation" data-cites="Nelson:1993nf">@Nelson:1993nf</span>, which says that if a theory has a scalar potential with a global minimum that breaks supersymmetry by a non-zero <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term, and the superpotential is generic (contains all terms not forbidden by symmetries), then the theory must have an exact <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry. If the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry remains unbroken when supersymmetry breaks, as is the case in the O’Raifeartaigh model discussed above, then there is a problem of explaining how gauginos get masses, because non-zero gaugino mass terms have <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-charge <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. On the other hand, if the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry is spontaneously broken, then there results a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-axion) which is problematic experimentally, although gravitational effects may give it a large enough mass to avoid being ruled out <span class="citation" data-cites="Raxion">@Raxion</span>.</p>
<p>If the supersymmetry breaking vacuum is only metastable, then one does not need an exact <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry. This can be illustrated by adding to the O’Raifeartaigh superpotential eq. ([oraif]) a term <span class="math inline">\(\Delta W\)</span> that explicitly breaks the continuous <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry. For example, consider <span class="citation" data-cites="Intriligator:2007py">@Intriligator:2007py</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta W &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \epsilon m \Phi_2^2,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a small dimensionless parameter, so that the tree-level scalar potential is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;
V_{\rm tree-level} \&gt;=\&gt; |F_1|^2 + |F_2|^2 + |F_3|^2,
\\
&amp;&amp; F_1 = k - {y\over 2} \phi_3^{*2} ,\qquad
F_2 = -\epsilon m \phi_2^* -m \phi^*_3 ,\qquad
F_3 = -m \phi^*_2 - y \phi^*_1 \phi^*_3 .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In accord with the Nelson-Seiberg theorem, there are now (two) supersymmetric minima, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\phi_1 \,=\, m/\epsilon y,
\qquad
\phi_2 \,=\, \pm \frac{1}{\epsilon} \sqrt{2k/y},
\qquad
\phi_3 \,=\, \mp \sqrt{2k/y}.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> However, for small enough <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the local supersymmetry-breaking minimum at <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1=\phi_2=\phi_3=0\)</span> is also still present and stabilized by the one-loop effective potential, with potential barriers between it and the supersymmetric minima, so the situation is qualitatively like Figure [fig:susybreakingpotentials](c). As <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the supersymmetric global minima move off to infinity in field space, and there is negligible effect on the supersymmetry-breaking local minimum. One can show <span class="citation" data-cites="Intriligator:2007py">@Intriligator:2007py</span> that the lifetime of the metastable vacuum state due to quantum tunneling can be made arbitrarily large. The same effect can be realized by a variety of other perturbations to the O’Raifeartaigh model; by eliminating the continuous <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry using small additional contributions to the Lagrangian, the stable supersymmetry breaking vacuum is converted to a metastable one. (In some cases, the Lagrangian remains invariant under a discrete <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> symmetry.)</p>
<p>The O’Raifeartaigh superpotential determines the mass scale of supersymmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{F_1}\)</span> in terms of a dimensionful parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> put in by hand. This appears somewhat artificial, since <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will have to be tiny compared to <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}^2\)</span> in order to give the right order of magnitude for the MSSM soft terms. It may be more plausible to have a mechanism that can instead generate such scales naturally. This can be done in models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking, in which the small mass scales associated with supersymmetry breaking arise by dimensional transmutation. In other words, they generally feature a new asymptotically free non-Abelian gauge symmetry with a gauge coupling <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that is perturbative at <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span> and gets strong in the infrared at some smaller scale <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda \sim e^{-8\pi^2/|b| g_0^2} {M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(g_0\)</span> is the running gauge coupling at <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span> with negative beta function <span class="math inline">\(- |b| g^3/16 \pi^2\)</span>. Just as in QCD, it is perfectly natural for <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> to be many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. Supersymmetry breaking may then be best described in terms of the effective dynamics of the strongly coupled theory. Supersymmetry is still broken by the VEV of an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> field, but it may be the auxiliary field of a composite chiral supermultiplet built out of fields that are charged under the new strongly coupled gauge group.</p>
<p>The construction of such models that break supersymmetry through strong-coupling dynamics is non-trivial if one wants a stable supersymmetry-breaking ground state. In addition to the argument from the Nelson-Seiberg theorem that a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_R\)</span> symmetry should be present, one can prove using the Witten index <span class="citation" data-cites="Wittenindex AffleckDineSeiberg">@Wittenindex [@AffleckDineSeiberg]</span> that any strongly coupled gauge theory with only vectorlike, massive matter cannot spontaneously break supersymmetry in its true ground state. However, things are easier if one only requires a local (metastable) minimum of the potential. Intriligator, Seiberg, and Shih showed <span class="citation" data-cites="Intriligator:2006dd">@Intriligator:2006dd</span> that supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with vectorlike matter can have metastable vacuum states with non-vanishing <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms that break supersymmetry, and lifetimes that can be arbitrarily long. The simplest model that does this is remarkably economical; it is just supersymmetric <span class="math inline">\(SU(N_c)\)</span> gauge theory, with <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> massive flavors of quark and antiquark supermultiplets, with <span class="math inline">\(N_c + 1 \leq N_f &lt; 3 N_c/2\)</span>. The recognition of the advantages of a metastable vacuum state opens up many new model building possibilities and ideas <span class="citation" data-cites="Intriligator:2006dd Intriligator:2007py metastablemodels">@Intriligator:2006dd [@Intriligator:2007py; @metastablemodels]</span>.</p>
<p>The topic of known ways of breaking supersymmetry spontaneously through strongly coupled gauge theories is a big subject that is in danger of becoming vast, and is beyond the scope of this primer. Fortunately, there are several excellent reviews, including <span class="citation" data-cites="susybreakingrevs">@susybreakingrevs</span> for the more recent developments and <span class="citation" data-cites="dynamicalsusybreaking">@dynamicalsusybreaking</span> for older models with stable vacua. Finding the ultimate cause of supersymmetry breaking is one of the most important goals for the future. However, for many purposes, one can simply assume that an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term has obtained a VEV, without worrying about the specific dynamics that caused it. For understanding collider phenomenology, the most immediate concern is usually the nature of the couplings of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term VEV to the MSSM fields. This is the subject we turn to next.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-a-separate-supersymmetry-breaking-sector-subsecorigins.sector"><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> The need for a separate supersymmetry-breaking sector [subsec:origins.sector]</h2>
<p>It is now clear that spontaneous supersymmetry breaking (dynamical or not) requires us to extend the MSSM. The ultimate supersymmetry-breaking order parameter cannot belong to any of the MSSM supermultiplets; a <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term VEV for <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> does not lead to an acceptable spectrum, and there is no candidate gauge singlet whose <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term could develop a VEV. Therefore one must ask what effects <span><em>are</em></span> responsible for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, and how supersymmetry breakdown is “communicated” to the MSSM particles. It is very difficult to achieve the latter in a phenomenologically viable way working only with renormalizable interactions at tree-level, even if the model is extended to involve new supermultiplets including gauge singlets. First, on general grounds it would be problematic to give masses to the MSSM gauginos, because the results of section [sec:susylagr] inform us that renormalizable supersymmetry never has any (scalar)-(gaugino)-(gaugino) couplings that could turn into gaugino mass terms when the scalar gets a VEV. Second, at least some of the MSSM squarks and sleptons would have to be unacceptably light, and should have been discovered already. This can be understood from the existence of sum rules that can be obtained in the same way as eq. ([eq:supertracesumrule]) when the restrictions imposed by flavor symmetries are taken into account. For example, in the limit in which lepton flavors are conserved, the selectron mass eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_2\)</span> could in general be mixtures of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_R\)</span>. But if they do not mix with other scalars, then part of the sum rule decouples from the rest, and one obtains: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\tilde e_1}^2 + m_{\tilde e_2}^2 = 2 m_e^2,
\label{eq:sumrulee}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which is of course ruled out by experiment. Similar sum rules follow for each of the fermions of the Standard Model, at tree-level and in the limits in which the corresponding flavors are conserved. In principle, the sum rules can be evaded by introducing flavor-violating mixings, but it is very difficult to see how to make a viable model in this way. Even ignoring these problems, there is no obvious reason why the resulting MSSM soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in this type of model should satisfy flavor-blindness conditions like eqs. ([scalarmassunification]) or ([aunification]).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we expect that the MSSM soft terms arise indirectly or radiatively, rather than from tree-level renormalizable couplings to the supersymmetry-breaking order parameters. Supersymmetry breaking evidently occurs in a “hidden sector” of particles that have no (or only very small) direct couplings to the “visible sector” chiral supermultiplets of the MSSM. However, the two sectors do share some interactions that are responsible for mediating supersymmetry breaking from the hidden sector to the visible sector, resulting in the MSSM soft terms. (See Figure [fig:structure].)</p>
<p>In this scenario, the tree-level squared mass sum rules need not hold, even approximately, for the physical masses of the visible sector fields, so that a phenomenologically viable superpartner mass spectrum is, in principle, achievable. As a bonus, if the mediating interactions are flavor-blind, then the soft terms appearing in the MSSM will automatically obey conditions like eqs. ([scalarmassunification]), ([aunification]) and ([commonphase]).</p>
<p>There have been two main competing proposals for what the mediating interactions might be. The first (and historically the more popular) is that they are gravitational. More precisely, they are associated with the new physics, including gravity, that enters near the Planck scale. In this “gravity-mediated”, or <span><em>Planck-scale-mediated supersymmetry breaking</em></span> (PMSB) scenario, if supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector by a VEV <span class="math inline">\(\langle F\rangle\)</span>, then the soft terms in the visible sector should be roughly <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\rm soft} \&gt;\sim\&gt; {\langle F \rangle / {M_{\rm P}}},
\label{mgravusual}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> by dimensional analysis. This is because we know that <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> must vanish in the limit <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle \rightarrow 0\)</span> where supersymmetry is unbroken, and also in the limit <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\rightarrow \infty\)</span> (corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(G_{\rm Newton} \rightarrow 0\)</span>) in which gravity becomes irrelevant. For <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> of order a few hundred GeV, one would therefore expect that the scale associated with the origin of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector should be roughly <span class="math inline">\({\sqrt{\langle F\rangle}} \sim 10^{10}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(10^{11}\)</span> GeV.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that the flavor-blind mediating interactions for supersymmetry breaking are the ordinary electroweak and QCD gauge interactions. In this <span><em>gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking</em></span> (GMSB) scenario, the MSSM soft terms come from loop diagrams involving some <span><em>messenger</em></span> particles. The messengers are new chiral supermultiplets that couple to a supersymmetry-breaking VEV <span class="math inline">\(\langle F\rangle\)</span>, and also have <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span> interactions, which provide the necessary connection to the MSSM. Then, using dimensional analysis, one estimates for the MSSM soft terms <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\rm soft} \sim {\alpha_a\over 4\pi} {\langle F \rangle
\over M_{\rm mess}}
\label{mgravgmsb}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_a/4\pi\)</span> is a loop factor for Feynman diagrams involving gauge interactions, and <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess}\)</span> is a characteristic scale of the masses of the messenger fields. So if <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F\rangle}\)</span> are roughly comparable, then the scale of supersymmetry breaking can be as low as about <span class="math inline">\({\sqrt{\langle F\rangle}} \sim 10^4\)</span> GeV (much lower than in the gravity-mediated case!) to give <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> of the right order of magnitude.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:origins.gravitino"><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> The goldstino and the gravitino</h2>
<p>As shown in section [subsec:origins.general], the spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry implies the existence of a massless Weyl fermion, the goldstino. The goldstino is the fermionic component of the supermultiplet whose auxiliary field obtains a VEV.</p>
<p>We can derive an important property of the goldstino by considering the form of the conserved supercurrent eq. ([supercurrent]). Suppose for simplicity<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> that the only non-vanishing auxiliary field VEV is <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span> with goldstino superpartner <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}G\)</span>. Then the supercurrent conservation equation tells us that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
0 = \partial_\mu J^\mu_\alpha =
-i \langle F \rangle (\sigma^\mu \partial_\mu {\widetilde}G^\dagger)_\alpha +
\partial_\mu j^\mu_\alpha + \ldots
\label{beezlebub}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(j^\mu_\alpha\)</span> is the part of the supercurrent that involves all of the other supermultiplets, and the ellipses represent other contributions of the goldstino supermultiplet to <span class="math inline">\(\partial_\mu J^\mu_\alpha\)</span>, which we can ignore. [The first term in eq. ([beezlebub]) comes from the second term in eq. ([supercurrent]), using the equation of motion <span class="math inline">\(F_i = -W^{*}_i\)</span> for the goldstino’s auxiliary field.] This equation of motion for the goldstino field allows us to write an effective Lagrangian <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\rm goldstino}
=  i {\widetilde}G^\dagger {\overline\sigma}^\mu \partial_\mu {\widetilde}G 
- {1\over \langle F \rangle}({\widetilde}G \partial_\mu j^\mu
+ {{{\rm c.c.}}}) ,
\label{goldstinointeraction}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which describes the interactions of the goldstino with all of the other fermion-boson pairs <span class="citation" data-cites="Fayetsupercurrent">@Fayetsupercurrent</span>. In particular, since <span class="math inline">\(j^\mu_\alpha = (\sigma^\nu{\overline\sigma}^\mu \psi_i)_\alpha \partial_\nu\phi^{*i} {\ominus}\sigma^\nu {\overline\sigma}^\rho \sigma^\mu \lambda^{\dagger a} F_{\nu\rho}^a/2\sqrt{2} + \ldots\)</span>, there are goldstino-scalar-chiral fermion and goldstino-gaugino-gauge boson vertices as shown in Figure [fig:goldstino].

<p>supercurrent conservation, eq. ([goldstinointeraction]) holds independently of the details of how supersymmetry breaking is communicated from <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span> to the MSSM sector fields <span class="math inline">\((\phi_i,\psi_i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\lambda^a, A^a)\)</span>. It may appear strange at first that the interaction couplings in eq. ([goldstinointeraction]) get larger in the limit <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span> goes to zero. However, the interaction term <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}G \partial_\mu j^\mu\)</span> contains two derivatives, which turn out to always give a kinematic factor proportional to the squared-mass difference of the superpartners when they are on-shell, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(m_{\phi}^2 - m_{\psi}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\lambda} - m_{A}^2\)</span> for Figures [fig:goldstino]a and [fig:goldstino]b respectively. These can be non-zero only by virtue of supersymmetry breaking, so they must also vanish as <span class="math inline">\(\langle F\rangle \rightarrow 0\)</span>, and the interaction is well-defined in that limit. Nevertheless, for fixed values of <span class="math inline">\(m_{\phi}^2 - m_{\psi}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\lambda} - m_{A}^2\)</span>, the interaction term in eq. ([goldstinointeraction]) can be phenomenologically important if $F $ is not too large <span class="citation" data-cites="Fayetsupercurrent">@Fayetsupercurrent</span><span class="citation" data-cites="AKKMM2">@AKKMM2</span>.</p>
<p>The above remarks apply to the breaking of global supersymmetry. However, taking into account gravity, supersymmetry must be promoted to a local symmetry. This means that the spinor parameter <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^\alpha\)</span>, which first appeared in section [subsec:susylagr.freeWZ], is no longer a constant, but can vary from point to point in spacetime. The resulting locally supersymmetric theory is called <span><em>supergravity</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="supergravity superconformalsupergravity">@supergravity [@superconformalsupergravity]</span>. It necessarily unifies the spacetime symmetries of ordinary general relativity with local supersymmetry transformations. In supergravity, the spin-2 graviton has a spin-3/2 fermion superpartner called the gravitino, which we will denote <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\Psi_\mu^\alpha\)</span>. The gravitino has odd <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity (<span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span>), as can be seen from the definition eq. ([defRparity]). It carries both a vector index (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and a spinor index (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>), and transforms inhomogeneously under local supersymmetry transformations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\delta {\widetilde}\Psi_\mu^\alpha \&gt;=\&gt; 
\partial_\mu\epsilon^\alpha +\ldots
\label{gravitinoisgauge}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Thus the gravitino should be thought of as the “gauge” field of local supersymmetry transformations [compare eq. ([Agaugetr])]. As long as supersymmetry is unbroken, the graviton and the gravitino are both massless, each with two spin helicity states. Once supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, the gravitino acquires a mass by absorbing (“eating”) the goldstino, which becomes its longitudinal (helicity <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1/2\)</span>) components. This is called the <span><em>super-Higgs</em></span> mechanism, and it is analogous to the ordinary Higgs mechanism for gauge theories, by which the <span class="math inline">\(W^\pm\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span> gauge bosons in the Standard Model gain mass by absorbing the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken electroweak gauge invariance. The massive spin-3/2 gravitino now has four helicity states, of which two were originally assigned to the would-be goldstino. The gravitino mass is traditionally called <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span>, and in the case of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term breaking it can be estimated as <span class="citation" data-cites="gravitinomassref">@gravitinomassref</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{3/2} \&gt;\sim\&gt; {\langle F \rangle / {M_{\rm P}}},
\label{gravitinomass}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This follows simply from dimensional analysis, since <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> must vanish in the limits that supersymmetry is restored (<span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle \rightarrow 0\)</span>) and that gravity is turned off (<span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\rightarrow \infty\)</span>). Equation ([gravitinomass]) implies very different expectations for the mass of the gravitino in gravity-mediated and in gauge-mediated models, because they usually make very different predictions for <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Planck-scale-mediated supersymmetry breaking case, the gravitino mass is comparable to the masses of the MSSM sparticles [compare eqs. ([mgravusual]) and ([gravitinomass])]. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> is expected to be at least of order 100 GeV or so. Its interactions will be of gravitational strength, so the gravitino will not play any role in collider physics, but it can be important in cosmology <span class="citation" data-cites="cosmogravitino">@cosmogravitino</span>. If it is the LSP, then it is stable and its primordial density could easily exceed the critical density, causing the universe to become matter-dominated too early. Even if it is not the LSP, the gravitino can cause problems unless its density is diluted by inflation at late times, or it decays sufficiently rapidly.</p>
<p>In contrast, gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models predict that the gravitino is much lighter than the MSSM sparticles as long as <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess} \ll {M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. This can be seen by comparing eqs. ([mgravgmsb]) and ([gravitinomass]). The gravitino is almost certainly the LSP in this case, and all of the MSSM sparticles will eventually decay into final states that include it. Naively, one might expect that these decays are extremely slow. However, this is not necessarily true, because the gravitino inherits the non-gravitational interactions of the goldstino it has absorbed. This means that the gravitino, or more precisely its longitudinal (goldstino) components, can play an important role in collider physics experiments. The mass of the gravitino can generally be ignored for kinematic purposes, as can its transverse (helicity <span class="math inline">\(\pm 3/2\)</span>) components, which really do have only gravitational interactions. Therefore in collider phenomenology discussions one may interchangeably use the same symbol <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}G\)</span> for the goldstino and for the gravitino of which it is the longitudinal (helicity <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1/2\)</span>) part. By using the effective Lagrangian eq. ([goldstinointeraction]), one can compute that the decay rate of any sparticle <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X\)</span> into its Standard Model partner <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> plus a goldstino/gravitino <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}G\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Gamma({\widetilde}X \rightarrow X{\widetilde}G) \,=\,
{m^5_{{\widetilde}X} \over 16 \pi \langle F \rangle^2}
\left ( 1 - {m_X^2/ m_{{\widetilde}X}^2} \right )^4 .
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{generalgravdecay}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This corresponds to either Figure [fig:goldstino]a or [fig:goldstino]b, with <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}X,X) = (\phi,\psi)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((\lambda,A)\)</span> respectively. One factor <span class="math inline">\((1 - m_X^2/m_{{\widetilde}X}^2 )^2\)</span> came from the derivatives in the interaction term in eq. ([goldstinointeraction]) evaluated for on-shell final states, and another such factor comes from the kinematic phase space integral with <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2} \ll m_{{\widetilde}X}, m_X\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the supermultiplet containing the goldstino and <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span> has canonically normalized kinetic terms, and the tree-level vacuum energy is required to vanish, then the estimate eq. ([gravitinomass]) is sharpened to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{3/2} \&gt;=\&gt; {\langle F \rangle / \sqrt{3} {M_{\rm P}}} .
\label{gravitinomassbogus}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In that case, one can rewrite eq. ([generalgravdecay]) as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Gamma({\widetilde}X \rightarrow X{\widetilde}G) \,=\,
{m_{{\widetilde}X}^5 \over 48 \pi {M_{\rm P}}^2 m_{3/2}^2}
\left ( 1 - {m_X^2/ m_{{\widetilde}X}^2} \right )^4 ,
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{specificgravdecay}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and this is how the formula is sometimes presented, although it is less general since it assumes eq. ([gravitinomassbogus]). The decay width is larger for smaller <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span>, or equivalently for smaller <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span>, if the other masses are fixed. If <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X\)</span> is a mixture of superpartners of different Standard Model particles <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then each partial width in eq. ([generalgravdecay]) should be multiplied by a suppression factor equal to the square of the cosine of the appropriate mixing angle. If <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\widetilde}X}\)</span> is of order 100 GeV or more, and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{ \langle F\rangle } {\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{\)</span>&lt;<span class="math inline">\(}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{\)</span><span class="math inline">\(}}\ifdim \wd1&gt;\wd0\kern.5\wd1\kern-.5\wd0\fi \copy0\kern-.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\copy1\ifdim\wd0&gt;\wd1 \kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}\)</span> few <span class="math inline">\(\times 10^6\)</span> GeV [corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> less than roughly 1 keV according to eq. ([gravitinomassbogus])], then the decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X \rightarrow X {\widetilde}G\)</span> can occur quickly enough to be observed in a modern collider detector. This implies some interesting phenomenological signatures, which we will discuss further in sections [subsec:decays.gravitino] and [sec:signals].</p>

In particular, if we write the visible sector superpotential as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>Note that couplings of the form <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm maybe~soft}\)</span> in eq. ([lagrsoftprime]) do not arise from eq. ([hiddengrav]). Although they actually are expected to occur, the largest possible sources for them are non-renormalizable Kähler potential terms, which lead to: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>In principle, the parameters <span class="math inline">\(f_a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k^i_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_i^j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y^{Xijk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{Xij}\)</span> ought to be determined by the fundamental underlying theory. The familiar flavor blindness of gravity expressed in Einstein’s equivalence principle does not, by itself, tell us anything about their form. Therefore, the requirement of approximate flavor blindness in <span class="math inline">\({\cal L}_{\rm soft}\)</span> is a new assumption in this framework, and is not guaranteed without further structure. Nevertheless, it has historically been popular to make a dramatic simplification by assuming a “minimal” form for the normalization of kinetic terms and gauge interactions in the non-renormalizable Lagrangian. Specifically, it is often assumed that there is a common <span class="math inline">\(f_a=f\)</span> for the three gauginos, that <span class="math inline">\(k_i^j = k \delta_i^j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_i^j = n \delta_i^j\)</span> are the same for all scalars, with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> real, and that the other couplings are proportional to the corresponding superpotential parameters, so that <span class="math inline">\(y^{Xijk} = \alpha y^{ijk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{Xij} = \beta \mu^{ij}\)</span> with universal real dimensionless constants <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Then the soft terms in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal L}}_{\rm soft}^{\rm MSSM}\)</span> are all determined by just four parameters: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

<p>Equations ([gauginounificationsugra])-([bsilly]) also have the virtue of being extraordinarily predictive, at least in principle. [Of course, eq. ([bsilly]) is content-free unless one can relate <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> to the other parameters in some non-trivial way.] As discussed in sections [subsec:mssm.hints] and [subsec:RGEs], they should be applied as RG boundary conditions at the scale <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. The RG evolution of the soft parameters down to the electroweak scale will then allow us to predict the entire MSSM spectrum in terms of just five parameters <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (plus the already-measured gauge and Yukawa couplings of the MSSM). A popular approximation is to start this RG running from the unification scale <span class="math inline">\(M_U\approx 1.5\times 10^{16}\)</span> GeV instead of <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. The reason for this is more practical than principled; the apparent unification of gauge couplings gives us a strong hint that we know something about how the RG equations behave up to <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>, but unfortunately gives us little guidance about what to expect at scales between <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. The errors made in neglecting these effects are proportional to a loop suppression factor times ln<span class="math inline">\(({M_{\rm P}}/M_U)\)</span>. These corrections hopefully can be partly absorbed into a redefinition of <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>, but in many cases will lead to other important effects <span class="citation" data-cites="PP">@PP</span> that are difficult to anticipate.</p>
<p>The framework described in the previous two paragraphs has been the subject of the bulk of phenomenological and experimental studies of supersymmetry, and has become a benchmark scenario for experimental collider search limits. It is sometimes referred to as the <span><em>minimal supergravity</em></span> (MSUGRA) or <span><em>Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</em></span> (CMSSM) scenario for the soft terms.</p>
<p>Particular models of gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can be even more predictive, relating some of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> to each other and to the mass of the gravitino <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span>. For example, three popular kinds of models for the soft terms are:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> Dilaton-dominated: <span class="citation" data-cites="dilatondominated">@dilatondominated</span>   <span class="math inline">\(m^2_0 = m^2_{3/2}\)</span>,    <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2} = -A_0 = {\sqrt 3} m_{3/2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> Polonyi: <span class="citation" data-cites="polonyi">@polonyi</span>    <span class="math inline">\(m^2_0 = m^2_{3/2}\)</span>,     <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = (3 -{\sqrt 3}) m_{3/2}\)</span>,     <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2} = {\cal O}(m_{3/2})\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bullet\)</span> “No-scale”: <span class="citation" data-cites="noscale">@noscale</span>   <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2} \gg m_0, A_0, m_{3/2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Dilaton domination arises in a particular limit of superstring theory. While it appears to be highly predictive, it can easily be generalized in other limits <span class="citation" data-cites="stringsoft">@stringsoft</span>. The Polonyi model has the advantage of being the simplest possible model for supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector, but it is rather <span><em>ad hoc</em></span> and does not seem to have a special place in grander schemes like superstrings. The “no-scale” limit may appear in a low-energy limit of superstrings in which the gravitino mass scale is undetermined at tree-level (hence the name). It implies that the gaugino masses dominate over other sources of supersymmetry breaking near <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. As we saw in section [subsec:RGEs], RG evolution feeds the gaugino masses into the squark, slepton, and Higgs squared-mass parameters with sufficient magnitude to give acceptable phenomenology at the electroweak scale. More recent versions of the no-scale scenario, however, also can give significant <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> at the input scale. In many cases <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> can also be predicted in terms of the other parameters, but this is quite sensitive to model assumptions. For phenomenological studies, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> are usually just taken to be convenient but imperfect (and perhaps downright misleading) parameterizations of our ignorance of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. In a more perfect world, experimental searches might be conducted and reported using something like the larger 15-dimensional flavor-blind parameter space of eqs. ([scalarmassunification])-([commonphase]), but such a higher dimensional parameter space is difficult to simulate comprehensively, for practical reasons.</p>
<p>Let us now review in a little more detail how the soft supersymmetry breaking terms can arise in supergravity models. The part of the scalar potential that does not depend on the gauge kinetic function can be found as follows. First, one may define the real, dimensionless <span><em>Kähler function</em></span> in terms of the Kähler potential and superpotential with the chiral superfields replaced by their scalar components: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
G \&gt;=\&gt; 
{K/{M_{\rm P}}^2} + {\rm ln}({W/{M_{\rm P}}^3}) +{\rm ln}{(W^*/{M_{\rm P}}^3)}.
\label{eq:defKahlerfun}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Many references use units with <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}=1\)</span>, which simplifies the expressions but can slightly obscure the correspondence with the global supersymmetry limit of large <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. From <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, one can construct its derivatives with respect to the scalar fields and their complex conjugates: <span class="math inline">\(G^i = {\delta G/\delta \phi_i}\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(G_i = {\delta G/\delta \phi^{* i}}\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(G_i^j = {\delta^2 G/\delta\phi^{* i}\delta\phi_j}\)</span>. As in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral], raised (lowered) indices <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> correspond to derivatives with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\phi^{*i}\)</span>). Note that <span class="math inline">\(G_i^j = K_i^j/{M_{\rm P}}^2\)</span>, which is often called the Kähler metric, does not depend on the superpotential. The inverse of this matrix is denoted <span class="math inline">\((G^{-1})_i^j\)</span>, or equivalently <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}^2 (K^{-1})_i^j\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\((G^{-1})^k_i G_k^j = (G^{-1})^j_k G_i^k = \delta_i^j\)</span>. In terms of these objects, the generalization of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term contribution to the scalar potential in ordinary renormalizable global supersymmetry turns out <span class="citation" data-cites="supergravity superconformalsupergravity">@supergravity [@superconformalsupergravity]</span> to be: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_F \&gt;=\&gt; {M_{\rm P}}^4 \, e^G \Bigl [ G^i (G^{-1})_i^j G_j -3 \Bigr ]
\label{vsugra}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in supergravity. It can be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_F \&gt;=\&gt; K_i^j F_j F^{*i} - 3 e^{K/{M_{\rm P}}^2} WW^*/{M_{\rm P}}^2 ,
\label{compactvsugra}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
F_i \&gt;=\&gt; -{M_{\rm P}}^2\, e^{G/2} \, (G^{-1})_i^j G_j 
    \&gt;=\&gt; -e^{K/2 {M_{\rm P}}^2}\, (K^{-1})_i^j
\Bigl ( W^*_j + W^* K_j/{M_{\rm P}}^2 \Bigr ),
\label{fisugra}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(K^i = \delta K/\delta \phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_j = \delta K/\delta \phi^{*j}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> are order parameters for supersymmetry breaking in supergravity (generalizing the auxiliary fields in the renormalizable global supersymmetry case). In other words, local supersymmetry will be broken if one or more of the <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> obtain a VEV. The gravitino then absorbs the would-be goldstino and obtains a squared mass <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{3/2} \,=\, \langle K_j^i F_i F^{*j}\rangle/3{M_{\rm P}}^2.
\label{sugragravitinomass}\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking a minimal Kähler potential $ K = ^{*i} _i $, one has <span class="math inline">\(K_i^j=(K^{-1})_i^j = \delta_i^j\)</span>, so that expanding eqs. ([compactvsugra]) and ([fisugra]) to lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(1/{M_{\rm P}}\)</span> just reproduces the results <span class="math inline">\(F_i = -W^*_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V = F_i F^{*i} = W^i W_i^*\)</span>, which were found in section [subsec:susylagr.chiral] for renormalizable global supersymmetric theories [see eqs. ([replaceF])-([ordpot])]. Equation ([sugragravitinomass]) also reproduces the expression for the gravitino mass that was quoted in eq. ([gravitinomass]).</p>
<p>The scalar potential eq. ([vsugra]) does not include the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions from gauge interactions, which are given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_D \&gt;=\&gt; {1\over 2}{\rm Re}[f_{ab}\, {\widehat D}^a {\widehat 
D}^b],
\label{eq:defVD}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\widehat D^a = f_{ab}^{-1} \widetilde D^b\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde D}^a \equiv 
-G^i (T^a)_i{}^j \phi_j = -\phi^{*j} (T^a)_j{}^i G_i =
-K^i (T^a)_i{}^j \phi_j = -\phi^{*j} (T^a)_j{}^i K_i, \end{eqnarray}\]</span> are real order parameters of supersymmetry breaking, with the last three equalities following from the gauge invariance of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Note that in the tree-level global supersymmetry case <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab} = \delta_{ab}/g_a^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K^i = \phi^{*i}\)</span>, eq. ([eq:defVD]) reproduces the result of section [subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter] for the renormalizable global supersymmetry <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term scalar potential, with <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{D}^a = g_a D^a\)</span> (no sum on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). The full scalar potential is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V = V_F + V_D,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and it depends on <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> only through the combination <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in eq. ([eq:defKahlerfun]). There are many other contributions to the supergravity Lagrangian involving fermions and vectors, which can be found in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="supergravity superconformalsupergravity">@supergravity [@superconformalsupergravity]</span>, and also turn out to depend only on <span class="math inline">\(f_{ab}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. This allows one to consistently redefine <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> so that there are no purely holomorphic or purely anti-holomorphic terms appearing in the latter.</p>
<p>Unlike in the case of global supersymmetry, the scalar potential in supergravity is <span><em>not</em></span> necessarily non-negative, because of the <span class="math inline">\(-3\)</span> term in eq. ([vsugra]). Therefore, in principle, one can have supersymmetry breaking with a positive, negative, or zero vacuum energy. Results in experimental cosmology <span class="citation" data-cites="cosmokramer">@cosmokramer</span> imply a positive vacuum energy associated with the acceleration of the scale factor of the observable universe, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm observed} = \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi G_{\rm Newton}} \approx 
(2.3 \times 10^{-12}\&gt;{\rm GeV})^4,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> but this is also certainly tiny compared to the scales associated with supersymmetry breaking. Therefore, it is tempting to simply assume that the vacuum energy is 0 within the approximations pertinent for working out the supergravity effects on particle physics at collider energies. However, it is notoriously unclear <span><em>why</em></span> the terms in the scalar potential in a supersymmetry-breaking vacuum should conspire to give <span class="math inline">\(\langle V \rangle \approx 0\)</span> at the minimum. A naive estimate, without miraculous cancellations, would give instead $ V $ of order <span class="math inline">\(|\langle F \rangle|^2\)</span>, so at least roughly (<span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> GeV)<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span> for Planck-scale mediated supersymmetry breaking, or (<span class="math inline">\(10^4\)</span> GeV)<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span> for gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore, while <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\rm vac} = \langle V \rangle\)</span> classically, the former is a very large-distance scale measured quantity, while the latter is associated with effective field theories at length scales comparable to and shorter than those familiar to high energy physics. So, in the absence of a compelling explanation for the tiny value of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\rm vac}\)</span>, it is not at all clear that <span class="math inline">\(\langle V \rangle \approx 0\)</span> is really the right condition to impose <span class="citation" data-cites="cosmock">@cosmock</span>. Nevertheless, with <span class="math inline">\(\langle V \rangle = 0\)</span> imposed as a constraint, eqs. ([compactvsugra])-([sugragravitinomass]) tell us that $ K_j^i F_i F^{*j} = 3 {M_{}}^4 e^{G } = 3 e^{K /{M_{}}^2} |W |<sup>2/{M_{}}</sup>2$, and an equivalent formula for the gravitino mass is therefore <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2} = e^{\langle G\rangle/2} {M_{\rm P}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting special case arises if we assume a minimal Kähler potential and divide the fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> into a visible sector including the MSSM fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_i\)</span>, and a hidden sector containing a field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that breaks supersymmetry for us (and other fields that we need not treat explicitly). In other words, suppose that the superpotential and the Kähler potential have the forms <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W &amp;=&amp; W_{\rm vis}(\varphi_i) + W_{\rm hid}(X),
\label{minw}\\
K &amp;=&amp; \varphi^{*i} \varphi_i + X^* X .
\label{mink}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now let us further assume that the dynamics of the hidden sector fields provides non-zero VEVs <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle X \rangle = x {M_{\rm P}},\qquad
\langle W_{\rm hid}\rangle = w {M_{\rm P}}^2,\qquad
\langle \delta W_{\rm hid}/\delta X \rangle = w^\prime {M_{\rm P}},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which define a dimensionless quantity <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w^\prime\)</span> with dimensions of [mass]. Requiring<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(\langle V \rangle = 0\)</span> yields <span class="math inline">\(|w^\prime + x^* w|^2 = 3 |w|^2\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{3/2} \&gt;=\&gt; {|\langle F_X \rangle |/\sqrt{3} {M_{\rm P}}} \&gt;=\&gt; e^{|x|^2/2}|w|.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Now we suppose that it is valid to expand the scalar potential in powers of the dimensionless quantities <span class="math inline">\(w/{M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w^\prime/{M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_i/{M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, etc., keeping only terms that depend on the visible sector fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_i\)</span>. In leading order the result is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V &amp;=&amp; (W^*_{\rm vis})_i (W_{\rm vis})^i + m_{3/2}^2
\varphi^{*i}\varphi_{i}
\nonumber \\ &amp;&amp; \!\!
+ e^{|x|^2/2} \left [w^* \varphi_i (W_{\rm vis})^i\, +\,
(x^* w^{\prime *} + |x|^2 w^* - 3 w^*) W_{\rm vis} + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\right
].\qquad{}
\label{yapot}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> A tricky point here is that we have rescaled the visible sector superpotential <span class="math inline">\(W_{\rm vis} \rightarrow e^{-|x|^2/2} W_{\rm vis}\)</span> everywhere, in order that the first term in eq. ([yapot]) is the usual, properly normalized, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term contribution in global supersymmetry. The next term is a universal soft scalar squared mass of the form eq. ([scalarunificationsugra]) with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_0^2 \&gt;=\&gt; {|\langle F_X \rangle|^2/ 3 {M_{\rm P}}^2}
\&gt;=\&gt; m_{3/2}^2 .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The second line of eq. ([yapot]) just gives soft (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> and (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> holomorphic couplings of the form eqs. ([aunificationsugra]) and ([bsilly]), with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
A_0 \,=\, - x^* {\langle F_X \rangle / {M_{\rm P}}},
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;
B_0 \,=\, \Bigl (
{1\over x + w^{\prime *}/w^*} -x^*\Bigr ){\langle F_X \rangle / {M_{\rm P}}}
\qquad{}
\label{a0b0x}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_i (W_{\rm vis})^i\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(3 W_{\rm vis}\)</span> for the cubic part of <span class="math inline">\(W_{\rm vis}\)</span>, and to <span class="math inline">\(2 W_{\rm vis}\)</span> for the quadratic part. [If the complex phases of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w^\prime\)</span> can be rotated away, then eq. ([a0b0x]) implies <span class="math inline">\(B_0 = A_0 - m_{3/2}\)</span>, but there are many effects that can ruin this prediction.] The Polonyi model mentioned in section [subsec:origins.sugra] is just the special case of this exercise in which <span class="math inline">\(W_{\rm hid}\)</span> is assumed to be linear in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason why <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> must have the simple form eq. ([minw]) and eq. ([mink]). In general, the superpotential and Kähler potential will have terms coupling <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the MSSM fields as in eqs. ([eq:WnonrenormX]) and ([eq:KnonrenormX]). If one now plugs such terms into eq. ([vsugra]), one obtains a general form like eq. ([hiddengrav]) for the soft terms. It is only when special assumptions are made [like eqs. ([minw]), ([mink])] that one gets the phenomenologically desirable results in eqs. ([sillyassumptions])-([bsilly]). Thus supergravity by itself does not guarantee universality or even flavor-blindness of the soft terms.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:origins.gmsb"><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models</h2>
<p>In gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models <span class="citation" data-cites="oldgmsb newgmsb">@oldgmsb [@newgmsb]</span>, the ordinary gauge interactions, rather than gravity, are responsible for the appearance of soft supersymmetry breaking in the MSSM. The basic idea is to introduce some new chiral supermultiplets, called messengers, that couple to the ultimate source of supersymmetry breaking, and also couple indirectly to the (s)quarks and (s)leptons and higgs(inos) of the MSSM through the ordinary <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\)</span> gauge boson and gaugino interactions. There is still gravitational communication between the MSSM and the source of supersymmetry breaking, of course, but that effect is now relatively unimportant compared to the gauge interaction effects.</p>
<p>In contrast to Planck-scale mediation, GMSB can be understood entirely in terms of loop effects in a renormalizable framework. In the simplest such model, the messenger fields are a set of left-handed chiral supermultiplets <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\overline q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\overline \ell\)</span> transforming under <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
q\sim({\bf 3},{\bf 1}, -{1\over 3}),\qquad\!\!\!
\overline q\sim({\bf \overline 3},{\bf 1}, {1\over 3}),\qquad\!\!\!
\ell \sim({\bf 1},{\bf 2}, {1\over 2}),\qquad\!\!\!
\overline \ell\sim({\bf 1},{\bf 2}, -{1\over 2}).\qquad\!\!\!{}
\label{minimalmess}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These supermultiplets contain messenger quarks <span class="math inline">\(\psi_q, \psi_{\overline q}\)</span> and scalar quarks <span class="math inline">\(q, \overline q\)</span> and messenger leptons <span class="math inline">\(\psi_\ell, \psi_{\overline \ell}\)</span> and scalar leptons <span class="math inline">\(\ell, \overline \ell\)</span>. All of these particles must get very large masses so as not to have been discovered already. Assume they do so by coupling to a gauge-singlet chiral supermultiplet <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> through a superpotential: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W_{\rm mess} \, = \, y_2 S \ell \overline \ell + y_3 S q \overline q .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The scalar component of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and its auxiliary (<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term) component are each supposed to acquire VEVs, denoted $S $ and $ F_S $ respectively. This can be accomplished either by putting <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> into an O’Raifeartaigh-type model <span class="citation" data-cites="oldgmsb">@oldgmsb</span>, or by a dynamical mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="newgmsb">@newgmsb</span>. Exactly how this happens is an interesting and important question, with many possible answers but no clear favorite at present. Here, we will simply parameterize our ignorance of the precise mechanism of supersymmetry breaking by asserting that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> participates in another part of the superpotential, call it <span class="math inline">\(W_{\rm breaking}\)</span>, which provides for the necessary spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the mass spectrum of the messenger fermions and bosons. The fermionic messenger fields pair up to get mass terms: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}&amp;=&amp; 
- y_2 \langle S \rangle \psi_\ell \psi_{\overline \ell}
- y_3 \langle S \rangle \psi_q \psi_{\overline q} + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\label{messfermass}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> as in eq. ([lagrchiral]). Meanwhile, their scalar messenger partners <span class="math inline">\(\ell,\overline\ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q,\overline q\)</span> have a scalar potential given by (neglecting <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions, which do not affect the following discussion): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V &amp;=&amp; 
\left | {\delta {W_{\rm mess}}\over \delta \ell} \right |^2 +
\left | {\delta {W_{\rm mess}}\over \delta \overline\ell} \right |^2 +
\left | {\delta {W_{\rm mess}}\over \delta q} \right |^2 +
\left | {\delta {W_{\rm mess}}\over \delta \overline q} \right |^2 +
\left | {\delta \over \delta S}  ({W_{\rm mess}}+ W_{\rm breaking}) \right |^2
\&gt;\phantom{xxx}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> as in eq. ([ordpot]). Now, suppose that, at the minimum of the potential, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle S \rangle &amp;\not=&amp; 0,\\
\langle \delta W_{\rm breaking}/\delta S \rangle  
&amp;=&amp; -\langle F_S^* \rangle \&gt;\not=\&gt; 0,\\
\langle \delta {W_{\rm mess}}/\delta S  \rangle  &amp;=&amp; 0.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Replacing <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_S\)</span> by their VEVs, one finds quadratic mass terms in the potential for the messenger scalar leptons: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V &amp;=&amp; 
|y_2 \langle S \rangle|^2 \bigl ( |\ell|^2 + 
|\overline \ell |^2 \bigr ) +
|y_3 \langle S \rangle|^2 \bigl ( |q|^2 + 
|\overline q|^2 \bigr )
\nonumber \\
&amp;&amp;-\left (y_2 \langle F_S \rangle \ell\overline \ell 
+ y_3 \langle F_S \rangle q\overline q + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\right )
\nonumber

\label{nosteenkinlabel}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first line in eq. ([nosteenkinlabel]) represents supersymmetric mass terms that go along with eq. ([messfermass]), while the second line consists of soft supersymmetry-breaking masses. The complex scalar messengers <span class="math inline">\(\ell,\overline\ell\)</span> thus obtain a squared-mass matrix equal to: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

In just the same way, the scalars <span class="math inline">\(q,\overline q\)</span> get squared masses <span class="math inline">\(|y_3 \langle S\rangle |^2 \pm |y_3 \langle F_S \rangle |\)</span>.</p>
<p>So far, we have found that the effect of supersymmetry breaking is to split each messenger supermultiplet pair apart: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\ell,\overline\ell : \qquad &amp; m_{\rm fermions}^2 = |y_2 \langle S\rangle

<p>The scalar and fermion lines in the loop are messenger fields. Recall that the interaction vertices in Figure [fig:1loop] are of gauge coupling strength even though they do not involve gauge bosons; compare Figure [fig:gauge]g. In this way, gauge-mediation provides that <span class="math inline">\(q,\overline q\)</span> messenger loops give masses to the gluino and the bino, and <span class="math inline">\(\ell,\overline \ell\)</span> messenger loops give masses to the wino and bino fields. Computing the 1-loop diagrams, one finds <span class="citation" data-cites="newgmsb">@newgmsb</span> that the resulting MSSM gaugino masses are given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_a \,=\, {\alpha_a\over 4\pi} \Lambda , \qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;(a=1,2,3) ,
\label{gauginogmsb}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in the normalization for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_a\)</span> discussed in section [subsec:mssm.hints], where we have introduced a mass parameter <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Lambda \,\equiv\, \langle F_S\rangle/\langle S \rangle \&gt; .
\label{defLambda}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> (Note that if <span class="math inline">\(\langle F_S\rangle\)</span> were 0, then <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda=0\)</span> and the messenger scalars would be degenerate with their fermionic superpartners and there would be no contribution to the MSSM gaugino masses.) In contrast, the corresponding MSSM gauge bosons cannot get a corresponding mass shift, since they are protected by gauge invariance. So supersymmetry breaking has been successfully communicated to the MSSM (“visible sector”). To a good approximation, eq. ([gauginogmsb]) holds for the running gaugino masses at an RG scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span> corresponding to the average characteristic mass of the heavy messenger particles, roughly of order <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess} \sim y_I \langle S \rangle\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(I = 2,3\)</span>. The running mass parameters can then be RG-evolved down to the electroweak scale to predict the physical masses to be measured by future experiments.</p>
<p>The scalars of the MSSM do not get any radiative corrections to their masses at one-loop order. The leading contribution to their masses comes from the two-loop graphs shown in Figure [fig:2loops], with the messenger fermions (heavy solid lines) and messenger scalars (heavy dashed lines) and ordinary gauge bosons and gauginos running around the loops.</p>
<p>By computing these graphs, one finds that each MSSM scalar <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> gets a squared mass given by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{\phi_i} \,=\,
2 {\Lambda^2}
\left [ \left ({\alpha_3\over 4\pi}\right )^2 C_3(i) +
\left ({\alpha_2\over
4 \pi}\right )^2 C_2(i) +
\left ({\alpha_1\over 4 \pi}\right )^2 C_1(i) \right ] ,
\label{scalargmsb}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with the quadratic Casimir invariants <span class="math inline">\(C_a(i)\)</span> as in eqs. ([eq:defCasimir])-([defC1]). The squared masses in eq. ([scalargmsb]) are positive (fortunately!).</p>
<p>The terms <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_e\)</span> arise first at two-loop order, and are suppressed by an extra factor of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_a/4 \pi\)</span> compared to the gaugino masses. So, to a very good approximation one has, at the messenger scale, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf a_u} = {\bf a_d} = {\bf a_e} = 0,
\label{aaagmsb}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> a significantly stronger condition than eq. ([aunification]). Again, eqs. ([scalargmsb]) and ([aaagmsb]) should be applied at an RG scale equal to the average mass of the messenger fields running in the loops. However, evolving the RG equations down to the electroweak scale generates non-zero <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\bf a_e\)</span> proportional to the corresponding Yukawa matrices and the non-zero gaugino masses, as indicated in section [subsec:RGEs]. These will only be large for the third-family squarks and sleptons, in the approximation of eq. ([heavytopapprox]). The parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> may also be taken to vanish near the messenger scale, but this is quite model-dependent, and in any case <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> will be non-zero when it is RG-evolved to the electroweak scale. In practice, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be fixed in terms of the other parameters by the requirement of correct electroweak symmetry breaking, as discussed below in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs].</p>
<p>Because the gaugino masses arise at <span><em>one</em></span>-loop order and the scalar squared-mass contributions appear at <span><em>two</em></span>-loop order, both eq. ([gauginogmsb]) and ([scalargmsb]) correspond to the estimate eq. ([mgravgmsb]) for <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess} \sim y_I \langle S \rangle\)</span>. Equations ([gauginogmsb]) and ([scalargmsb]) hold in the limit of small <span class="math inline">\(\langle F_S \rangle /y_I\langle S \rangle^2\)</span>, corresponding to mass splittings within each messenger supermultiplet that are small compared to the overall messenger mass scale. The sub-leading corrections in an expansion in <span class="math inline">\(\langle F_S \rangle /y_I\langle S \rangle^2\)</span> turn out <span class="citation" data-cites="gmsbcorrA">@gmsbcorrA</span><span class="citation" data-cites="gmsbcorrC">@gmsbcorrC</span> to be quite small unless there are very large messenger mass splittings.</p>
<p>The model we have described so far is often called the minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Let us now generalize it to a more complicated messenger sector. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(q, \overline q\)</span> and $, $ are replaced by a collection of messengers <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_I,\overline \Phi_I\)</span> with a superpotential <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W_{\rm mess} \,=\, \sum_I y_I S \Phi_I \overline \Phi_I . \end{eqnarray}\]</span> The bar is used to indicate that the left-handed chiral superfields <span class="math inline">\(\overline \Phi_I\)</span> transform as the complex conjugate representations of the left-handed chiral superfields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_I\)</span>. Together they are said to form a “vectorlike” (self-conjugate) representation of the Standard Model gauge group. As before, the fermionic components of each pair <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline\Phi_I\)</span> pair up to get squared masses <span class="math inline">\(|y_I \langle S \rangle|^2\)</span> and their scalar partners mix to get squared masses $|y_I S |^2 |y_I F_S | $. The MSSM gaugino mass parameters induced are now <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_a \,=\, {\alpha_a\over 4\pi} \Lambda \sum_I n_a(I) \qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;(a=1,2,3)
\label{gauginogmsbgen}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_a(I)\)</span> is the Dynkin index for each <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_I+\overline \Phi_I\)</span>, in a normalization where <span class="math inline">\(n_3 = 1\)</span> for a <span class="math inline">\({\bf 3} + {\bf \overline 3}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 1\)</span> for a pair of doublets of <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span>, one has <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = 6Y^2/5\)</span> for each messenger pair with weak hypercharges <span class="math inline">\(\pm Y\)</span>. In computing <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> one must remember to add up the contributions for each component of an <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> multiplet. So, for example, <span class="math inline">\((n_1, n_2, n_3) = (2/5, 0, 1)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(q+\overline q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((n_1, n_2, n_3) = (3/5, 1, 0)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\ell+\overline \ell\)</span>. Thus the total is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_I (n_1, n_2, n_3) = (1, 1, 1)\)</span> for the minimal model, so that eq. ([gauginogmsbgen]) is in agreement with eq. ([gauginogmsb]). On general group-theoretic grounds, <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_3\)</span> must be integers, and <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> is always an integer multiple of <span class="math inline">\(1/5\)</span> if fractional electric charges are confined.</p>
<p>The MSSM scalar masses in this generalized gauge mediation framework are now: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{\phi_i} \,=\,
2 \Lambda^2
\left [ \left ({\alpha_3\over 4\pi}\right )^2 C_3(i) \sum_I n_3(I) +
\left ({\alpha_2\over 4 \pi}\right )^2 C_2(i) \sum_I n_2(I)+
\left ({\alpha_1\over 4 \pi}\right )^2 C_1(i) \sum_I n_1(I)
\right ] .\phantom{xx}
\label{scalargmsbgen}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In writing eqs. ([gauginogmsbgen]) and ([scalargmsbgen]) as simple sums, we have implicitly assumed that the messengers are all approximately equal in mass, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_{\rm mess} \,\approx\, y_I \langle S \rangle .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Equation ([scalargmsbgen]) is still not a bad approximation if the <span class="math inline">\(y_I\)</span> are not very different from each other, because the dependence of the MSSM mass spectrum on the <span class="math inline">\(y_I\)</span> is only logarithmic (due to RG running) for fixed <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. However, if large hierarchies in the messenger masses are present, then the additive contributions to the gaugino masses and scalar squared masses from each individual messenger multiplet <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> should really instead be incorporated at the mass scale of that messenger multiplet. Then RG evolution is used to run these various contributions down to the electroweak or TeV scale; the individual messenger contributions to scalar and gaugino masses as indicated above can be thought of as threshold corrections to this RG running.</p>
<p>Messengers with masses far below the GUT scale will affect the running of gauge couplings and might therefore be expected to ruin the apparent unification shown in Figure [fig:gaugeunification]. However, if the messengers come in complete multiplets of the <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> global symmetry<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> that contains the Standard Model gauge group, and are not very different in mass, then approximate unification of gauge couplings will still occur when they are extrapolated up to the same scale <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span> (but with a larger unified value for the gauge couplings at that scale). For this reason, a popular class of models is obtained by taking the messengers to consist of <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span> copies of the <span class="math inline">\({\bf 5}+{\bf \overline 5}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span>, resulting in <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_I n_1(I) = \sum_I n_2(I) =\sum_I n_3(I) = {N_5}\&gt; .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Equations ([gauginogmsbgen]) and ([scalargmsbgen]) then reduce to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;M_a \,=\, {\alpha_a \over 4 \pi} \Lambda {N_5},
\label{gmsbgauginonmess}\\
&amp;&amp;m^2_{\phi_i} \,=\, 2 \Lambda^2 {N_5}\sum_{a=1}^3 C_a(i) \left ({\alpha_a\over 4\pi}\right )^2 ,
\label{gmsbnmess}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> since now there are <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span> copies of the minimal messenger sector particles running around the loops. For example, the minimal model in eq. ([minimalmess]) corresponds to <span class="math inline">\({N_5}= 1\)</span>. A single copy of <span class="math inline">\({\bf 10} + {\bf \overline{ 10}}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> has Dynkin indices <span class="math inline">\(\sum_I n_a(I) = 3\)</span>, and so can be substituted for 3 copies of <span class="math inline">\({\bf 5}+{\bf \overline 5}\)</span>. (Other combinations of messenger multiplets can also preserve the apparent unification of gauge couplings.) Note that the gaugino masses scale like <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span>, while the scalar masses scale like <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{{N_5}}\)</span>. This means that sleptons and squarks will tend to be lighter relative to the gauginos for larger values of <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span> in non-minimal models. However, if <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span> is too large, then the running gauge couplings will diverge before they can unify at <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>. For messenger masses of order <span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> GeV or less, for example, one needs <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\leq 4\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many other possible generalizations of the basic gauge-mediation scenario as described above; see for example refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="gmsbcorrB">@gmsbcorrB</span><span class="citation" data-cites="GGMb">@GGMb</span>. The common feature that makes all such models attractive is that the masses of the squarks and sleptons depend only on their gauge quantum numbers, leading automatically to the degeneracy of squark and slepton masses needed for suppression of flavor-changing effects. But the most distinctive phenomenological prediction of gauge-mediated models may be the fact that the gravitino is the LSP. This can have crucial consequences for both cosmology and collider physics, as we will discuss further in sections [subsec:decays.gravitino] and [sec:signals].</p>
<h2 id="subsec:origins.amsb"><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Extra-dimensional and anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking</h2>
<p>It is also possible to take the partitioning of the MSSM and supersymmetry breaking sectors shown in fig. [fig:structure] seriously as geography. This can be accomplished by assuming that there are extra spatial dimensions of the Kaluza-Klein or warped type <span class="citation" data-cites="warped">@warped</span>, so that a physical distance separates the visible and hidden<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> sectors. This general idea opens up numerous possibilities, which are hard to classify in a detailed way. For example, string theory suggests six such extra dimensions, with a staggeringly huge number of possible solutions.</p>
<p>Many of the popular models used to explore this extra-dimensional mediated supersymmetry breaking (the acronym XMSB is tempting) use just one single hidden extra dimension with the MSSM chiral supermultiplets confined to one 4-dimensional spacetime brane and the supersymmetry-breaking sector confined to a parallel brane a distance <span class="math inline">\(R_5\)</span> away, separated by a 5-dimensional bulk, as in fig. [fig:branes].</p>

<p>Using this as an illustration, the dangerous flavor-violating terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(y^{Xijk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k^i_j\)</span> in eq. ([hiddengrav]) are suppressed by factors like <span class="math inline">\(e^{-R_5 M_5}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R_5\)</span> is the size of the 5th dimension and <span class="math inline">\(M_5\)</span> is the 5-dimensional fundamental (Planck) scale, and it is assumed that the MSSM chiral supermultiplets are confined to their brane. Therefore, it should be enough to require that <span class="math inline">\(R_5 M_5 \gg 1\)</span>, in other words that the size of the 5th dimension (or, more generally, the volume of the compactified space) is relatively large in units of the fundamental length scale. Thus the suppression of flavor-violating effects does not require any fine-tuning or extreme hierarchies, because it is exponential.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the gauge supermultiplets of the MSSM propagate in the bulk, and so mediate supersymmetry breaking <span class="citation" data-cites="MirabelliPeskin">@MirabelliPeskin</span><span class="citation" data-cites="deconstructedgauginomediation">@deconstructedgauginomediation</span>. This mediation is direct for gauginos, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_a \sim \frac{\langle F \rangle}{M_5(R_5 M_5)} ,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> but is loop-suppressed for the soft terms involving scalars. This implies that in the simplest version of the idea, often called “gaugino mediation”, soft supersymmetry breaking is dominated by the gaugino masses. The phenomenology is therefore quite similar to that of the “no-scale” boundary conditions mentioned in section [subsec:origins.sugra] in the context of PMSB models. Scalar squared masses and the scalar cubic couplings come from renormalization group running down to the electroweak scale. It is useful to keep in mind that gaugino mass dominance is really the essential feature that defeats flavor violation, so it may well turn out to be more robust than any particular model that provides it.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the gauge supermultiplet fields are also confined to the MSSM brane, so that the transmission of supersymmetry breaking is due entirely to supergravity effects. This leads to anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSB">@AMSB</span>, so-named because the resulting MSSM soft terms can be understood in terms of the anomalous violation of a local superconformal invariance, an extension of scale invariance. In one formulation of supergravity <span class="citation" data-cites="superconformalsupergravity">@superconformalsupergravity</span>, Newton’s constant (or equivalently, the Planck mass scale) is set by the VEV of a scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> that is part of a non-dynamical chiral supermultiplet (called the “conformal compensator”). As a gauge fixing, this field obtains a VEV of <span class="math inline">\(\langle \phi \rangle = 1\)</span>, spontaneously breaking the local superconformal invariance. Now, in the presence of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle \not= 0\)</span>, for example on the hidden brane, the auxiliary field component also obtains a non-zero VEV, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle F_\phi \rangle 
\,\sim\, 
\frac{\langle F \rangle}{{M_{\rm P}}} 
\,\sim\,
m_{3/2} .
\label{eq:AMSBgravitino}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The non-dynamical conformal compensator field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is taken to be dimensionless, so that <span class="math inline">\(F_\phi\)</span> has dimensions of [mass].</p>
<p>In the classical limit, there is still no supersymmetry breaking in the MSSM sector, due to the exponential suppression provided by the extra dimensions.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, there is an anomalous violation of superconformal (scale) invariance manifested in the running of the couplings. This causes supersymmetry breaking to show up in the MSSM by virtue of the non-zero beta functions and anomalous dimensions of the MSSM brane couplings and fields. The resulting soft terms are <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSB">@AMSB</span> (using <span class="math inline">\({F_\phi}\)</span> to denote its VEV from now on): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:AMSBscalar}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where the anomalous dimensions <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^i_j\)</span> are normalized as in eqs. ([eq:gengamma]) and ([eq:gammaHu])-([eq:gammae]). As in the GMSB scenario of the previous subsection, gaugino masses arise at one-loop order, but scalar squared masses arise at two-loop order. Also, these results are approximately flavor-blind for the first two families, because the non-trivial flavor structure derives only from the MSSM Yukawa couplings.</p>
<p>There are several unique features of the AMSB scenario. First, there is no need to specify at which renormalization scale eqs. ([eq:AMSBgauginos])-([eq:AMSBscalar]) should be applied as boundary conditions. This is because they hold at every renormalization scale, exactly, to all orders in perturbation theory. In other words, eqs. ([eq:AMSBgauginos])-([eq:AMSBscalar]) are not just boundary conditions for the renormalization group equations of the soft parameters, but solutions as well. (These AMSB renormalization group trajectories can also be found from this renormalization group invariance property alone <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBtrajectories">@AMSBtrajectories</span>, without reference to the supergravity derivation.) In fact, even if there are heavy supermultiplets in the theory that have to be decoupled, the boundary conditions hold both above and below the arbitrary decoupling scale. This remarkable insensitivity to ultraviolet physics in AMSB ensures the absence of flavor violation in the low-energy MSSM soft terms. Another interesting prediction is that the gravitino mass <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> in these models is actually much larger than the scale <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span> of the MSSM soft terms, since the latter are loop-suppressed compared to eq. ([eq:AMSBgravitino]).</p>
<p>There is only one unknown parameter, <span class="math inline">\({F_\phi}\)</span>, among the MSSM soft terms in AMSB. Unfortunately, this exemplary falsifiability is marred by the fact that it is already falsified. The dominant contributions to the first-family squark and slepton squared masses are: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{\tilde q} &amp;= &amp; \frac{|{F_\phi}|^2}{(16 \pi^2)^2} 
\left (8 g_3^4  + \ldots \right ),
\\
m^2_{\tilde e_L} &amp;= &amp; -\frac{|{F_\phi}|^2}{(16 \pi^2)^2} 
\left (\frac{3}{2} g_2^4 + \frac{99}{50} g_1^4 \right )
\\
m^2_{\tilde e_R} &amp;= &amp; 
-\frac{|{F_\phi}|^2}{(16 \pi^2)^2} \frac{198}{25} g_1^4\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The squarks have large positive squared masses, but the sleptons have negative squared masses, so the AMSB model in its simplest form is not viable. These signs come directly from those of the beta functions of the strong and electroweak gauge interactions, as can be seen from the right side of eq. ([eq:AMSBscalars]).</p>
<p>The characteristic ultraviolet insensitivity to physics at high mass scales also makes it somewhat non-trivial to modify the theory to escape this tachyonic slepton problem by deviating from the AMSB trajectory. There can be large deviations from AMSB provided by supergravity <span class="citation" data-cites="isAMSBrobust">@isAMSBrobust</span>, but then in general the flavor-blindness is also forfeit. One way to modify AMSB is to introduce additional supermultiplets that contain supersymmetry-breaking mass splittings that are large compared to their average mass <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBlightstates">@AMSBlightstates</span>. Another way is to combine AMSB with gaugino mediation <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBhybrid">@AMSBhybrid</span>. Some other proposals can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="otherAMSBattempts">@otherAMSBattempts</span>. Finally, there is a perhaps less motivated approach in which a common parameter <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> is added to all of the scalar squared masses at some scale, and chosen large enough to allow the sleptons to have positive squared masses above bounds from the CERN LEP <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider. This allows the phenomenology to be studied in a framework conveniently parameterized by just: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{F_\phi},\, m^2_0,\, \tan\beta,\, {\rm arg}(\mu),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> determined by requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking as described in the next section. (Some sources use <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm aux}\)</span> to denote $ {F_}$.) The MSSM gaugino masses at the leading non-trivial order are unaffected by the <span><em>ad hoc</em></span> addition of <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{{F_\phi}}{16 \pi^2} \frac{33}{5} g_1^2
\\
M_2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{{F_\phi}}{16 \pi^2} g_2^2
\\
M_3 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{{F_\phi}}{16 \pi^2} 3 g_3^2\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This implies that <span class="math inline">\(|M_2| \ll |M_1| \ll |M_3|\)</span>, so the lightest neutralino is actually mostly wino, with a lightest chargino that is only of order 200 MeV heavier, depending on the values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>. The decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^\pm \rightarrow {\widetilde}N_1 \pi^\pm\)</span> produces a very soft pion, implying unique and difficult signatures in colliders <span class="citation" data-cites="Chen:1996ap">@Chen:1996ap</span><span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBphenothree">@AMSBphenothree</span>.</p>
<p>Another large general class of models breaks supersymmetry using the geometric or topological properties of the extra dimensions. In the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="ScherkSchwarz">@ScherkSchwarz</span>, the symmetry is broken by assuming different boundary conditions for the fermion and boson fields on the compactified space. In supersymmetric models where the size of the extra dimension is parameterized by a modulus (a massless or nearly massless excitation) called a radion, the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-term component of the radion chiral supermultiplet can obtain a VEV, which becomes a source for supersymmetry breaking in the MSSM. These two ideas turn out to be often related. Some of the variety of models proposed along these lines can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="SSandradion">@SSandradion</span>. These mechanisms can also be combined with gaugino-mediation and AMSB. It seems likely that the possibilities are not yet fully explored.</p>

<h2 id="subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs bosons</h2>
<p>In the MSSM, the description of electroweak symmetry breaking is slightly complicated by the fact that there are two complex Higgs doublets <span class="math inline">\(H_u = (H_u^+,\&gt; H_u^0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d = (H_d^0,\&gt; H_d^-)\)</span> rather than just one in the ordinary Standard Model. The classical scalar potential for the Higgs scalar fields in the MSSM is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V\! &amp;=&amp;\!
(|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_u}) (|H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2)
+ (|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_d}) (|H_d^0|^2 + |H_d^-|^2)
\nonumber \\ &amp;&amp;

(|H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2 - |H_d^0|^2 - |H_d^-|^2 )^2
+ {{1\over 2}}g^2 |H_u^+ H_d^{0*} + H_u^0 H_d^{-*}|^2 .
\phantom{xxx}
\label{bighiggsv}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(|\mu |^2\)</span> come from <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms [see eq. ([movie])]. The terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(g^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^{\prime 2}\)</span> are the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions, obtained from the general formula eq. ([fdpot]) after some rearranging. Finally, the terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are just a rewriting of the last three terms of eq. ([MSSMsoft]). The full scalar potential of the theory also includes many terms involving the squark and slepton fields that we can ignore here, since they do not get VEVs because they have large positive squared masses.</p>
<p>We now have to demand that the minimum of this potential should break electroweak symmetry down to electromagnetism <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y \rightarrow U(1)_{\rm EM}\)</span>, in accord with observation. We can use the freedom to make gauge transformations to simplify this analysis. First, the freedom to make <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gauge transformations allows us to rotate away a possible VEV for one of the weak isospin components of one of the scalar fields, so without loss of generality we can take <span class="math inline">\(H_u^+=0\)</span> at the minimum of the potential. Then one can check that a minimum of the potential satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\partial V/\partial H_u^+=0\)</span> must also have <span class="math inline">\(H_d^- = 0\)</span>. This is good, because it means that at the minimum of the potential electromagnetism is necessarily unbroken, since the charged components of the Higgs scalars cannot get VEVs. After setting <span class="math inline">\(H_u^+=H_d^-=0\)</span>, we are left to consider the scalar potential <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V \!&amp;=&amp;\!
(|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_u}) |H_u^0|^2 + (|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_d}) |H_d^0|^2
- (b\, H_u^0 H_d^0 + {{{\rm c.c.}}})
\nonumber \\ &amp;&amp; 
+ {1\over 8} (g^2 + g^{\prime 2}) ( |H_u^0|^2 - |H_d^0|^2 )^2 .
\label{littlehiggsv}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The only term in this potential that depends on the phases of the fields is the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-term. Therefore, a redefinition of the phase of <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> can absorb any phase in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, so we can take <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to be real and positive. Then it is clear that a minimum of the potential <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> requires that <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0 H_d^0\)</span> is also real and positive, so <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_u^0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_d^0\rangle\)</span> must have opposite phases. We can therefore use a <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> gauge transformation to make them both be real and positive without loss of generality, since <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> have opposite weak hypercharges (<span class="math inline">\(\pm 1/2\)</span>). It follows that CP cannot be spontaneously broken by the Higgs scalar potential, since the VEVs and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be simultaneously chosen real, as a convention. This implies that the Higgs scalar mass eigenstates can be assigned well-defined eigenvalues of CP, at least at tree-level. (CP-violating phases in other couplings can induce loop-suppressed CP violation in the Higgs sector, but do not change the fact that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_u^0 \rangle\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_d \rangle\)</span> can always be chosen real and positive.)</p>
<p>In order for the MSSM scalar potential to be viable, we must first make sure that the potential is bounded from below for arbitrarily large values of the scalar fields, so that <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> will really have a minimum. (Recall from the discussion in sections [subsec:susylagr.chiral] and [subsec:susylagr.gaugeinter] that scalar potentials in purely supersymmetric theories are automatically non-negative and so clearly bounded from below. But, now that we have introduced supersymmetry breaking, we must be careful.) The scalar quartic interactions in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> will stabilize the potential for almost all arbitrarily large values of <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span>. However, for the special directions in field space <span class="math inline">\(|H_u^0| = |H_d^0|\)</span>, the quartic contributions to <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> [the second line in eq. ([littlehiggsv])] are identically zero. Such directions in field space are called <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-flat directions, because along them the part of the scalar potential coming from <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-terms vanishes. In order for the potential to be bounded from below, we need the quadratic part of the scalar potential to be positive along the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-flat directions. This requirement amounts to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
2 b &lt; 2 |\mu |^2 + m^2_{H_u} + m^2_{H_d}.
\label{eq:boundedfrombelow}\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-term always favors electroweak symmetry breaking. Requiring that one linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span> has a negative squared mass near <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0=H_d^0=0\)</span> gives <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
b^2 &gt; (|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_u} )(|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_d}).
\label{eq:destabilizeorigin}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> If this inequality is not satisfied, then <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0 = H_d^0 = 0\)</span> will be a stable minimum of the potential (or there will be no stable minimum at all), and electroweak symmetry breaking will not occur.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2 = m_{H_d}^2\)</span> then the constraints eqs. ([eq:boundedfrombelow]) and ([eq:destabilizeorigin]) cannot both be satisfied. In models derived from the MSUGRA or GMSB boundary conditions, <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2 = m_{H_d}^2\)</span> is supposed to hold at tree level at the input scale, but the <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> contribution to the RG equation for <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> [eq. ([mhurge])] naturally pushes it to negative or small values <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2 &lt; m_{H_d}^2\)</span> at the electroweak scale. Unless this effect is significant, the parameter space in which the electroweak symmetry is broken would be quite small. So, in these models electroweak symmetry breaking is actually driven by quantum corrections; this mechanism is therefore known as <span><em>radiative electroweak symmetry breaking</em></span>. Note that although a negative value for <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2\)</span> will help eq. ([eq:destabilizeorigin]) to be satisfied, it is not strictly necessary. Furthermore, even if <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2&lt;0\)</span>, there may be no electroweak symmetry breaking if <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|\)</span> is too large or if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is too small. Still, the large negative contributions to <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> from the RG equation are an important factor in ensuring that electroweak symmetry breaking can occur in models with simple boundary conditions for the soft terms. The realization that this works most naturally with a large top-quark Yukawa coupling provides additional motivation for these models <span class="citation" data-cites="rewsbone rewsbtwo">@rewsbone [@rewsbtwo]</span>.</p>
<p>Having established the conditions necessary for <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span> to get non-zero VEVs, we can now require that they are compatible with the observed phenomenology of electroweak symmetry breaking, <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \rightarrow U(1)_{\rm EM}\)</span>. Let us write <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
v_u = \langle H_u^0\rangle,
\qquad\qquad
v_d = \langle H_d^0\rangle.
\label{defvuvd}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These VEVs are related to the known mass of the <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span> boson and the electroweak gauge couplings: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
v_u^2 + v_d^2 = v^2 = 2 m_Z^2/(g^2 + g^{\prime 2}) \approx (174\&gt;{\rm
GeV})^2.
\label{vuvdcon}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The ratio of the VEVs is traditionally written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\tan\beta \equiv v_u/v_d.
\label{deftanbeta}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The value of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is not fixed by present experiments, but it depends on the Lagrangian parameters of the MSSM in a calculable way. Since <span class="math inline">\(v_u = v \sin\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_d = v \cos\beta\)</span> were taken to be real and positive by convention, we have <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \beta &lt; \pi/2\)</span>, a requirement that will be sharpened below. Now one can write down the conditions <span class="math inline">\(\partial V/\partial H_u^0= \partial V/\partial H_d^0 = 0\)</span> under which the potential eq. ([littlehiggsv]) will have a minimum satisfying eqs. ([vuvdcon]) and ([deftanbeta]): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;m_{H_u}^2 + |\mu |^2 -b \cot\beta - (m_Z^2/2) \cos (2\beta) 
\&gt;=\&gt; 0 ,
\label{mubsub2}
\\
&amp;&amp;m_{H_d}^2 + |\mu |^2 -b \tan\beta + (m_Z^2/2) \cos (2\beta) \&gt;=\&gt; 0.
\label{mubsub1}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> It is easy to check that these equations indeed satisfy the necessary conditions eqs. ([eq:boundedfrombelow]) and ([eq:destabilizeorigin]). They allow us to eliminate two of the Lagrangian parameters <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|\)</span> in favor of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, but do not determine the phase of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Taking <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2\)</span> as input parameters, and <span class="math inline">\(m_Z^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> as output parameters obtained by solving these two equations, one obtains: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\sin (2\beta) &amp;=&amp; \frac{2 b}{m^2_{H_u} + m^2_{H_d} + 2|\mu|^2},
\label{eq:solvesintwobeta}
\\
m_Z^2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{|m^2_{H_d} - m^2_{H_u}|}{\sqrt{1 - \sin^2(2\beta)}}
- m^2_{H_u} - m^2_{H_d} -2|\mu|^2
.
\label{eq:solvemzsq}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(\sin (2\beta)\)</span> is always positive. If <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{H_u} &lt; m^2_{H_d}\)</span>, as is usually assumed, then <span class="math inline">\(\cos(2\beta)\)</span> is negative; otherwise it is positive.</p>
<p>As an aside, eqs. ([eq:solvesintwobeta]) and ([eq:solvemzsq]) highlight the “<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem” already mentioned in section [subsec:mssm.superpotential]. Without miraculous cancellations, all of the input parameters ought to be within an order of magnitude or two of <span class="math inline">\(m^2_Z\)</span>. However, in the MSSM, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is a supersymmetry-respecting parameter appearing in the superpotential, while <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2\)</span> are supersymmetry-breaking parameters. This has lead to a widespread belief that the MSSM must be extended at very high energies to include a mechanism that relates the effective value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> to the supersymmetry-breaking mechanism in some way; see sections [subsec:variations.NMSSM] and [subsec:variations.munonrenorm] and ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="muproblemGMSB">@muproblemGMSB</span> for examples.</p>
<p>Even if the value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is set by soft supersymmetry breaking, the cancellation needed by eq. ([eq:solvemzsq]) is often remarkable when evaluated in specific model frameworks, after constraints from direct searches for the superpartners are taken into account. For example, expanding for large <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, eq. ([eq:solvemzsq]) becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_Z^2 = -2 (m^2_{H_u} + |\mu|^2) 
+ \frac{2}{\tan^2\beta} (m^2_{H_d} - m^2_{H_u})
+ {\cal O}(1/\tan^4\beta).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Typical viable solutions for the MSSM have <span class="math inline">\(-m^2_{H_u}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2\)</span> each much larger than <span class="math inline">\(m_Z^2\)</span>, so that significant cancellation is needed. In particular, large top squark squared masses, needed to avoid having the Higgs boson mass turn out too small [see eq. ([hradcorr]) below] compared to the observed value of 125 GeV, will feed into <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{H_u}\)</span>. The cancellation needed in the minimal model may therefore be at the several per cent level, or worse. It is impossible to objectively characterize whether this should be considered worrisome, but it certainly causes subjective worry as the LHC bounds on superpartners increase.</p>
<p>Equations ([mubsub2])-([eq:solvemzsq]) are based on the tree-level potential, and involve running renormalized Lagrangian parameters, which depend on the choice of renormalization scale. In practice, one must include radiative corrections at one-loop order, at least, in order to get numerically stable results. To do this, one can compute the loop corrections <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span> to the effective potential <span class="math inline">\(V_{\rm eff}(v_u, v_d) = V + \Delta V\)</span> as a function of the VEVs. The impact of this is that the equations governing the VEVs of the full effective potential are obtained by simply replacing <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{H_u} \rightarrow m^2_{H_u} + \frac{1}{2 v_u} 
\frac{\partial (\Delta V)}{\partial v_u},\qquad\qquad
m^2_{H_d} \rightarrow m^2_{H_d} + \frac{1}{2 v_d} 
\frac{\partial (\Delta V)}{\partial v_d}
\label{eq:Vradcor}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in eqs. ([mubsub2])-([eq:solvemzsq]), treating <span class="math inline">\(v_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_d\)</span> as real variables in the differentiation. The result for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span> has now been obtained through two-loop order in the MSSM <span class="citation" data-cites="twoloopEP twoloopEPMSSM">@twoloopEP [@twoloopEPMSSM]</span>. The most important corrections come from the one-loop diagrams involving the top squarks and top quark, and experience shows that the validity of the tree-level approximation and the convergence of perturbation theory are therefore improved by choosing a renormalization scale roughly of order the average of the top squark masses.</p>
<p>The Higgs scalar fields in the MSSM consist of two complex <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet, or eight real, scalar degrees of freedom. When the electroweak symmetry is broken, three of them are the would-be Nambu-Goldstone bosons <span class="math inline">\(G^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G^\pm\)</span>, which become the longitudinal modes of the <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W^\pm\)</span> massive vector bosons. The remaining five Higgs scalar mass eigenstates consist of two CP-even neutral scalars <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H^0\)</span>, one CP-odd neutral scalar <span class="math inline">\(A^0\)</span>, and a charge <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> scalar <span class="math inline">\(H^+\)</span> and its conjugate charge <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> scalar <span class="math inline">\(H^-\)</span>. (Here we define <span class="math inline">\(G^- = G^{+*}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H^- = H^{+*}\)</span>. Also, by convention, <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> is lighter than <span class="math inline">\(H^0\)</span>.) The gauge-eigenstate fields can be expressed in terms of the mass eigenstate fields as:</p>

<p>If the tree-level inequality ([eq:higgsineq]) were robust, the lightest Higgs boson of the MSSM would have been discovered in the previous century at the CERN LEP2 <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider, and its mass obviously could not approach the observed value of 125 GeV. However, the tree-level formula for the squared mass of <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> is subject to quantum corrections that are relatively drastic. The largest such contributions typically come from top and stop loops, as shown<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> in fig. [fig:MSSMhcorrections].</p>

<p>The term with <span class="math inline">\({\rm ln}(m_{\tilde t_1} m_{\tilde t_2} / m_t^2)\)</span> in eq. ([hradcorr]) then from comes the renormalization group running of the Higgs quartic coupling (due to the last diagram in fig. [fig:MSSMVcorrections]) down to the top-quark mass scale, which turns out to be a good renormalization scale at which to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}^2\)</span> within the Standard Model effective theory. For small or moderate top-squark mixing, the logarithmic running term is largest, but <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\rm threshold}\)</span> can also be quite important. These corrections to the Higgs effective quartic coupling increase the steepness of the Higgs potential, thus raising <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span> compared to the naive tree-level prediction.</p>
<p>The term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(c_{\tilde t}^2 s_{\tilde t}^2\)</span> in eq. ([eq:detDeltathreshold]) is positive definite, while the term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(c_{\tilde t}^4 s_{\tilde t}^4\)</span> is negative definite. For fixed top-squark masses, the maximum possible <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> mass therefore occurs for rather large top-squark mixing, <span class="math inline">\(c_{\tilde t}^2 s_{\tilde t}^2 = m_t^2/[m_{\tilde t_2}^2 + m_{\tilde t_1}^2 - 2 (m_{\tilde t_2}^2 - m_{\tilde t_1}^2)/{\rm ln}(m_{\tilde t_2}^2/m_{\tilde t_1}^2) ]\)</span> or 1/4, whichever is less. This is often referred to as the “maximal mixing” scenario for the MSSM Higgs sector. (What is being maximized is not the mixing, but <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span> with respect to the top-squark mixing.) It follows that the quantity in square brackets in eq. ([hradcorr]) is always less than <span class="math inline">\(\ln(m_{\tilde t_2}^2/m_t^2) + 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equation ([hradcorr]) already shows that <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span> can easily exceed the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> boson mass, and the observed value of <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV can in principle be accommodated. However, the above is a highly simplified account; to get reasonably accurate predictions for the Higgs scalar masses and mixings for a given set of model parameters, one must also include the remaining one-loop corrections and even the dominant two-loop and three-loop effects <span class="citation" data-cites="hcorrections">@hcorrections</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Vega:2015fna">@Vega:2015fna</span>. The theoretical uncertainties associated with the prediction of <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span>, given all of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, are still quite large, especially when the top-squarks are heavy, and are of order several GeV. For a recent review, see <span class="citation" data-cites="DraperRzehak">@DraperRzehak</span>.</p>
<p>Including such corrections, it had been estimated long before the discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson that <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{h^0} {\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{$&lt;$}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{$\sim$}}\ifdim

\kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}135\&gt;{\rm GeV}
\label{mssmhiggsbound}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in the MSSM. This prediction assumed that all of the sparticles that can contribute to <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}^2\)</span> in loops have masses that do not exceed 1 TeV, and the bound increases logarithmically with the top-squark masses. However, in many specific model frameworks with small or moderate top-squark mixing, the bound eq. ([mssmhiggsbound]) is very far from saturated, and it turns out to be a severe challenge to accommodate values even as large as the observed <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV, unless the top squarks are extremely heavy, or else highly mixed. Unfortunately, it is difficult to make this statement very precise, due both to the high dimensionality of the supersymmetric parameter space and the theoretical errors in the <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span> prediction.</p>
<p>In the MSSM, the masses and CKM mixing angles of the quarks and leptons are determined not only by the Yukawa couplings of the superpotential but also the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>. This is because the top, charm and up quark mass matrix is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(v_u = v \sin\beta\)</span> and the bottom, strange, and down quarks and the charge leptons get masses proportional to <span class="math inline">\(v_d = v \cos\beta\)</span>. At tree-level, <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_t \,=\, y_t v \sin\beta
,
\qquad\quad
m_b \,=\, y_b v \cos\beta
,
\qquad\quad
m_\tau = y_\tau v \cos\beta .\phantom{xxx}
\label{eq:ytbtaumtbtau}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These relations hold for the running masses rather than the physical pole masses, which are significantly larger for <span class="math inline">\(t,b\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="polecat">@polecat</span>. Including those corrections, one can relate the Yukawa couplings to <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> and the known fermion masses and CKM mixing angles. It is now clear why we have not neglected <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau\)</span>, even though <span class="math inline">\(m_b,m_\tau\ll m_t\)</span>. To a first approximation, <span class="math inline">\(y_b/y_t = (m_b/m_t)\tan\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau/y_t = (m_\tau/m_t)\tan\beta\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau\)</span> cannot be neglected if <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is much larger than 1. In fact, there are good theoretical motivations for considering models with large <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>. For example, models based on the GUT gauge group <span class="math inline">\(SO(10)\)</span> can unify the running top, bottom and tau Yukawa couplings at the unification scale; this requires <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> to be very roughly of order <span class="math inline">\(m_t/m_b\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="so10 copw">@so10 [@copw]</span>.</p>
<p>Note that if one tries to make <span class="math inline">\(\sin\beta\)</span> too small, then <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> will be nonperturbatively large. Requiring that <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> does not blow up above the electroweak scale, one finds that <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta {\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{\)</span>&gt;<span class="math inline">\(}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{\)</span><span class="math inline">\(}}\ifdim \wd1&gt;\wd0\kern.5\wd1\kern-.5\wd0\fi \copy0\kern-.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\copy1\ifdim\wd0&gt;\wd1 \kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}1.2\)</span> or so, depending on the mass of the top quark, the QCD coupling, and other details. In principle, there is also a constraint on <span class="math inline">\(\cos\beta\)</span> if one requires that <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau\)</span> do not become nonperturbatively large. This gives a rough upper bound of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta {\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{\)</span>&lt;<span class="math inline">\(}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{\)</span><span class="math inline">\(}}\ifdim \wd1&gt;\wd0\kern.5\wd1\kern-.5\wd0\fi \copy0\kern-.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\copy1\ifdim\wd0&gt;\wd1 \kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}\)</span> 65. However, this is complicated somewhat by the fact that the bottom quark mass gets significant one-loop non-QCD corrections in the large <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> limit <span class="citation" data-cites="copw">@copw</span>. One can obtain a stronger upper bound on <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> in some models where <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2 = m_{H_d}^2\)</span> at the input scale, by requiring that <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span> does not significantly exceed <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>. [Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(X_b\)</span> would be larger than <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> in eqs. ([mhurge]) and ([mhdrge]), so one would expect <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_d}^2 &lt; m_{H_u}^2\)</span> at the electroweak scale, and the minimum of the potential would have <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_d^0 \rangle &gt; \langle H_u^0 \rangle\)</span>. This would be a contradiction with the supposition that <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is large.] The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> also directly impacts the masses and mixings of the MSSM sparticles, as we will see below.</p>
<p>It is interesting to write the dependences on the angles <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of the tree-level couplings of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons. The bosonic couplings are proportional to: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

H^0 W^+W^-,\quad H^0 ZZ,\quad
Z h^0 A^0,\quad W^\pm h^0 H^\mp\&gt; &amp;\propto&amp; \cos(\beta-\alpha),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and the couplings to fermions are proportional to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

\\
A^0t\bar t\&gt; &amp;\propto&amp; \cot\beta.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> An important case, often referred to as the “decoupling limit”, occurs when <span class="math inline">\(m_{A^0} \gg m_Z\)</span>. Then the tree-level prediction for <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span> saturates its upper bound mentioned above, with $m<sup>2_{h</sup>0} m_Z^2 ^2 (2) + $ loop corrections. The particles <span class="math inline">\(A^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H^\pm\)</span> will be much heavier and nearly degenerate, forming an isospin doublet that decouples from sufficiently low-energy processes. The angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is very nearly <span class="math inline">\(\beta-\pi/2\)</span>, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\cos(\beta-\alpha) &amp;=&amp;

{\cal O}(m_Z^4/m_{A^0}^4),
\\
\sin(\beta-\alpha) &amp;=&amp; 1 - {\cal O}(m_Z^4/m_{A^0}^4),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> has nearly the same couplings to quarks and leptons and electroweak gauge bosons as would the Higgs boson of the ordinary Standard Model without supersymmetry. Radiative corrections modify these tree-level predictions, but model-building experiences have shown that it is not uncommon for <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> to behave in a way nearly indistinguishable from a Standard Model-like Higgs boson, even if <span class="math inline">\(m_{A^0}\)</span> is not too huge. The measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson observed at the LHC are indeed consistent, so far, with the Standard Model predictions, and it is sensible to identify this particle with <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span>. However, it should be kept in mind that the couplings of <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> might still turn out to deviate in measurable ways from those of a Standard Model Higgs boson. After including the effects of radiative corrections, the most significant effect for moderately large <span class="math inline">\(m_{A^0}\)</span> is a possible enhancement of the <span class="math inline">\(h^0 b \overline b\)</span> coupling compared to the value it would have in the Standard Model.</p>

The mass eigenvalues and the mixing matrix <span class="math inline">\({\bf N}_{ij}\)</span> can be given in closed form in terms of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, by solving quartic equations, but the results are very complicated and not illuminating.</p>
<p>In general, the parameters <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> in the equations above can have arbitrary complex phases. A redefinition of the phases of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W\)</span> always allows us to choose a convention in which <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> are both real and positive. The phase of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> within that convention is then really a physical parameter and cannot be rotated away. [We have already used up the freedom to redefine the phases of the Higgs fields, since we have picked <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_u^0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_d^0 \rangle\)</span> to be real and positive, to guarantee that the off-diagonal entries in eq. ([neutralinomassmatrix]) proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_Z\)</span> are real.] However, if <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is not real, then there can be potentially disastrous CP-violating effects in low-energy physics, including electric dipole moments for both the electron and the neutron. Therefore, it is usual [although not strictly mandatory, because of the possibility of nontrivial cancellations involving the phases of the (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings and the gluino mass] to assume that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is real in the same set of phase conventions that make <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_u^0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle H_d^0 \rangle\)</span> real and positive. The sign of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is still undetermined by this constraint.</p>
<p>In models that satisfy eq. ([gauginomassunification]), one has the nice prediction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_1 \approx {5\over 3}\tan^2\theta_W \, M_2 \approx 0.5 M_2
\label{usualm1m2}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> at the electroweak scale. If so, then the neutralino masses and mixing angles depend on only three unknown parameters. This assumption is sufficiently theoretically compelling that it has been made in most phenomenological studies; nevertheless it should be recognized as an assumption, to be tested someday by experiment.</p>
<p>There is a not-unlikely limit in which electroweak symmetry breaking effects can be viewed as a small perturbation on the neutralino mass matrix. If <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_Z \,\ll\, |\mu \pm M_{1}|,\, |\mu \pm M_{2}| ,
\label{gauginolike}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> then the neutralino mass eigenstates are very nearly a “bino-like” <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1 \approx {\widetilde}B\)</span>; a “wino-like” <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \approx {\widetilde}W^0\)</span>; and “higgsino-like” <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_3, {\widetilde}N_4 \approx ({\widetilde}H_u^0 \pm {\widetilde}H_d^0)/\sqrt{2}\)</span>, with mass eigenvalues: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{{{\widetilde}N}_1}\!\! &amp;=&amp;\!\! M_1 -

&amp;&amp;\!\!\! |\mu|  +

The subscript labels of the mass eigenstates may need to be rearranged depending on the numerical values of the parameters; in particular the above labeling of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> assumes <span class="math inline">\(M_1&lt; M_2 \ll |\mu|\)</span>. This limit, leading to a bino-like neutralino LSP, often emerges from MSUGRA boundary conditions on the soft parameters, which tend to require it in order to get correct electroweak symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>The chargino spectrum can be analyzed in a similar way. In the gauge-eigenstate basis <span class="math inline">\(\psi^\pm = ({\widetilde}W^+,\, {\widetilde}H_u^+,\, {\widetilde}W^- ,\, {\widetilde}H_d^- )\)</span>, the chargino mass terms in the Lagrangian are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

In the limit of eq. ([gauginolike]) with real <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the chargino mass eigenstates consist of a wino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^\pm\)</span> and and a higgsino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_2^\pm\)</span>, with masses <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

Amusingly, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> is degenerate with the neutralino <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> in the approximation shown, but that is not an exact result.

The case of <span class="math inline">\(M_1 \approx 0.5 M_2 \ll |\mu|\)</span> is not uncommonly found in viable models following from the boundary conditions in section [sec:origins], and it has been elevated to the status of a benchmark framework in many phenomenological studies. However it cannot be overemphasized that such expectations are not mandatory.</p>
<p>The Feynman rules involving neutralinos and charginos may be inferred in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\bf N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bf U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bf V\)</span> from the MSSM Lagrangian as discussed above; they are collected in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="HaberKanereview">@HaberKanereview</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="GunionHaber">@GunionHaber</span>. Feynman rules based on two-component spinor notation have also been given in <span class="citation" data-cites="DHM">@DHM</span>. In practice, the masses and mixing angles for the neutralinos and charginos are best computed numerically. Note that the discussion above yields the tree-level masses. Loop corrections to these masses can be significant, and have been found systematically at one-loop order in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="PBMZ">@PBMZ</span>, with partial two-loop results in <span class="citation" data-cites="GNCpoletwo NCpole">@GNCpoletwo [@NCpole]</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-gluinosubsecmssmspectrum.gluino"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> The gluino[subsec:MSSMspectrum.gluino]</h2>
<p>The gluino is a color octet fermion, so it cannot mix with any other particle in the MSSM, even if <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is violated. In this regard, it is unique among all of the MSSM sparticles. In models with MSUGRA or GMSB boundary conditions, the gluino mass parameter <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span> is related to the bino and wino mass parameters <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> by eq. ([gauginomassunification]), so <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_3 \,=\, {\alpha_s\over \alpha} \sin^2\theta_W\, 
M_2 \,=\, {3\over 5} {\alpha_s \over \alpha} \cos^2\theta_W\, M_1
\label{eq:TiaEla}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> at any RG scale, up to small two-loop corrections. This implies a rough prediction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
M_3 : M_2 : M_1 \approx 6:2:1\end{eqnarray}\]</span> near the TeV scale. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that the gluino is considerably heavier than the lighter neutralinos and charginos (even in many models where the gaugino mass unification condition is not imposed).</p>
<p>For more precise estimates, one must take into account the fact that <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span> is really a running mass parameter with an implicit dependence on the RG scale <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Because the gluino is a strongly interacting particle, <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span> runs rather quickly with <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> [see eq. ([gauginomassrge])]. A more useful quantity physically is the RG scale-independent mass <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde g}\)</span> at which the renormalized gluino propagator has a pole. Including one-loop corrections to the gluino propagator due to gluon exchange and quark-squark loops, one finds that the pole mass is given in terms of the running mass in the <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm DR}}\)</span> scheme by <span class="citation" data-cites="gluinopolemass">@gluinopolemass</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\tilde g} = M_3(Q) \Bigl ( 1 + {\alpha_s\over 4 \pi}

\bigl [
x m_{\tilde q}^2/M_3^2 + (1-x) m_{q}^2/M_3^2 - x(1-x) - i \epsilon
\bigr ].\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The sum in eq. ([gluinopole]) is over all 12 squark-quark supermultiplets, and we have neglected small effects due to squark mixing. [As a check, requiring <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde g}\)</span> to be independent of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> in eq. ([gluinopole]) reproduces the one-loop RG equation for <span class="math inline">\(M_3(Q)\)</span> in eq. ([gauginomassrge]).] The correction terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_s\)</span> in eq. ([gluinopole]) can be quite significant, because the gluino is strongly interacting, with a large group theory factor [the 15 in eq. ([gluinopole])] due to its color octet nature, and because it couples to all of the squark-quark pairs. The leading two-loop corrections to the gluino pole mass have also been found <span class="citation" data-cites="gluinopoletwo GNCpoletwo Martin:2006ub">@gluinopoletwo [@GNCpoletwo; @Martin:2006ub]</span>, and are implemented in the latest version of the <span>SOFTSUSY</span> program <span class="citation" data-cites="SOFTSUSY">@SOFTSUSY</span>.

<p>In principle, any scalars with the same electric charge, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity, and color quantum numbers can mix with each other. This means that with completely arbitrary soft terms, the mass eigenstates of the squarks and sleptons of the MSSM should be obtained by diagonalizing three <span class="math inline">\(6\times 6\)</span> squared-mass matrices for up-type squarks (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}c_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}c_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R\)</span>), down-type squarks (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}s_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}s_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_R\)</span>), and charged sleptons (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>), and one <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> matrix for sneutrinos (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\tau\)</span>). Fortunately, the general hypothesis of flavor-blind soft parameters eqs. ([scalarmassunification]) and ([aunification]) predicts that most of these mixing angles are very small. The third-family squarks and sleptons can have very different masses compared to their first- and second-family counterparts, because of the effects of large Yukawa (<span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau\)</span>) and soft (<span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_\tau\)</span>) couplings in the RG equations ([mq3rge])-([mstaubarrge]). Furthermore, they can have substantial mixing in pairs (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R\)</span>), (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_R\)</span>) and (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>). In contrast, the first- and second-family squarks and sleptons have negligible Yukawa couplings, so they end up in 7 very nearly degenerate, unmixed pairs <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}e_R, {\widetilde}\mu_R)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}\nu_e, {\widetilde}\nu_\mu)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}e_L, {\widetilde}\mu_L)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}u_R, {\widetilde}c_R)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}d_R, {\widetilde}s_R)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}u_L, {\widetilde}c_L)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}d_L, {\widetilde}s_L)\)</span>. As we have already discussed in section [subsec:mssm.hints], this avoids the problem of disastrously large virtual sparticle contributions to flavor-changing processes.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the spectrum of first- and second-family squarks and sleptons. In many models, including both MSUGRA [eq. ([scalarunificationsugra])] and GMSB [eq. ([scalargmsb])] boundary conditions, their running squared masses can be conveniently parameterized, to a good approximation, as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{Q_1}^2 = m_{Q_2}^2  \!\!\!&amp;=&amp;\!\!\! m_0^2 + K_3 + K_2 + {1\over 36}K_1,

\qquad\qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; \, +\, K_1.
\label{me1form}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> A key point is that the same <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> appear everywhere in eqs. ([mq1form])-([me1form]), since all of the chiral supermultiplets couple to the same gauginos with the same gauge couplings. The different coefficients in front of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> just correspond to the various values of weak hypercharge squared for each scalar.</p>
<p>In MSUGRA models, <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> is the same common scalar squared mass appearing in eq. ([scalarunificationsugra]). It can be very small, as in the “no-scale” limit, but it could also be the dominant source of the scalar masses. The contributions <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> are due to the RG running<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> proportional to the gaugino masses. Explicitly, they are found at one loop order by solving eq. ([easyscalarrge]): <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
K_a(Q) = \left\lbrace \matrix{{3/5}\cr {3/4} \cr {4/3}}

\label{kintegral}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0}\)</span> is the input RG scale at which the MSUGRA boundary condition eq. ([scalarunificationsugra]) is applied, and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> should be taken to be evaluated near the squark and slepton mass under consideration, presumably less than about 1 TeV. The running parameters <span class="math inline">\(g_a(Q)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_a(Q)\)</span> obey eqs. ([mssmg]) and ([gauginomassunification]). If the input scale is approximated by the apparent scale of gauge coupling unification <span class="math inline">\(Q_0 = M_U \approx 1.5 \times 10^{16}\)</span> GeV, one finds that numerically <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
K_1 \approx 0.15 m_{1/2}^2,\qquad

K_3 \approx (4.5\&gt;{\rm to}\&gt; 6.5) m_{1/2}^2.
\label{k123insugra}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> near the electroweak scale. Here <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span> is the common gaugino mass parameter at the unification scale. Note that <span class="math inline">\(K_3 \gg K_2 \gg K_1\)</span>; this is a direct consequence of the relative sizes of the gauge couplings <span class="math inline">\(g_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g_1\)</span>. The large uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span> is due in part to the experimental uncertainty in the QCD coupling constant, and in part to the uncertainty in where to choose <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span> runs rather quickly below 1 TeV. If the gauge couplings and gaugino masses are unified between <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>, as would occur in a GUT model, then the effect of RG running for <span class="math inline">\(M_U &lt; Q &lt; {M_{\rm P}}\)</span> can be absorbed into a redefinition of <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>. Otherwise, it adds a further uncertainty roughly proportional to ln<span class="math inline">\(({M_{\rm P}}/M_U)\)</span>, compared to the larger contributions in eq. ([kintegral]), which go roughly like ln<span class="math inline">\((M_U/1\)</span> TeV).</p>
<p>In gauge-mediated models, the same parameterization eqs. ([mq1form])-([me1form]) holds, but <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> is always 0. At the input scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span>, each MSSM scalar gets contributions to its squared mass that depend only on its gauge interactions, as in eq. ([scalargmsb]). It is not hard to see that in general these contribute in exactly the same pattern as <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span> in eq. ([mq1form])-([me1form]). The subsequent evolution of the scalar squared masses down to the electroweak scale again just yields more contributions to the <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span> parameters. It is somewhat more difficult to give meaningful numerical estimates for these parameters in GMSB models than in the MSUGRA models without knowing the messenger mass scale(s) and the multiplicities of the messenger fields. However, in the gauge-mediated case one quite generally expects that the numerical values of the ratios <span class="math inline">\(K_3/K_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_3/K_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_2/K_1\)</span> should be even larger than in eq. ([k123insugra]). There are two reasons for this. First, the running squark squared masses start off larger than slepton squared masses already at the input scale in gauge-mediated models, rather than having a common value <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>. Furthermore, in the gauge-mediated case, the input scale <span class="math inline">\(Q_0\)</span> is typically much lower than <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M_U\)</span>, so that the RG evolution gives relatively more weight to RG scales closer to the electroweak scale, where the hierarchies <span class="math inline">\(g_3&gt;g_2&gt;g_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_3&gt;M_2&gt;M_1\)</span> are already in effect.</p>
<p>In general, one therefore expects that the squarks should be considerably heavier than the sleptons, with the effect being more pronounced in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models than in MSUGRA models. For any specific choice of model, this effect can be easily quantified with a numerical RG computation. The hierarchy <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm squark} &gt; m_{\rm slepton}\)</span> tends to hold even in models that do not fit neatly into any of the categories outlined in section [sec:origins], because the RG contributions to squark masses from the gluino are always present and usually quite large, since QCD has a larger gauge coupling than the electroweak interactions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of model, there is also a “hyperfine” splitting in the squark and slepton mass spectrum, produced by electroweak symmetry breaking. Each squark and slepton <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> will get a contribution <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_\phi\)</span> to its squared mass, coming from the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term quartic interactions [see the last term in eq. ([fdpot])] of the form (squark)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>(Higgs)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> and (slepton)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>(Higgs)<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, when the neutral Higgs scalars <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span> get VEVs. They are model-independent for a given value of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_\phi \&gt;=\&gt; \frac{1}{2}
(T_{3\phi} g^2 - Y_\phi g^{\prime 2}) (v_d^2 - v_u^2) \&gt;=\&gt; 
(T_{3\phi} - Q_\phi\sin^2\theta_W)
\cos (2\beta)\, m_Z^2 ,
\label{defDeltaphi}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T_{3\phi}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_\phi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Q_\phi\)</span> are the third component of weak isospin, the weak hypercharge, and the electric charge of the left-handed chiral supermultiplet to which <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> belongs. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\tilde u_L} = ({1\over 2} - {2\over 3} \sin^2\theta_W)\cos (2\beta)\, m_Z^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\tilde d_L} = (-{1\over 2} + {1\over 3} \sin^2\theta_W)\cos (2\beta)\, m_Z^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\tilde u_R} = ({2\over 3} \sin^2\theta_W)\cos (2\beta) \, m_Z^2\)</span>. These <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions are typically smaller than the <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span> contributions, but should not be neglected. They split apart the components of the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet sleptons and squarks. Including them, the first-family squark and slepton masses are now given by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\tilde d_L}^2 \!\!&amp;=&amp;\!\! m_0^2 + K_3 + K_2 + {1\over 36} K_1 +
\Delta_{\tilde d_L},
\label{msdlform}
\\

K_1

\label{mserform}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with identical formulas for the second-family squarks and sleptons. The mass splittings for the left-handed squarks and sleptons are governed by model-independent sum rules <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m_{\tilde e_L}^2 -m_{\tilde \nu_e}^2 \,=\, 
m_{\tilde d_L}^2 -m_{\tilde u_L}^2 \,=\, 
g^2 (v_u^2 - v_d^2)/2 \,=\,  -\cos (2\beta)\, m_W^2  .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In the allowed range <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta&gt;1\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde e_L} &gt; m_{\tilde \nu_e}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde d_L} &gt; m_{\tilde u_L}\)</span>, with the magnitude of the splittings constrained by electroweak symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>Let us next consider the masses of the top squarks, for which there are several non-negligible contributions. First, there are squared-mass terms for <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t^*_L {\widetilde}t_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R^* {\widetilde}t_R\)</span> that are just equal to <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{Q_3} + \Delta_{\tilde u_L}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{{\overline}u_3} + \Delta_{\tilde u_R}\)</span>, respectively, just as for the first- and second-family squarks. Second, there are contributions equal to <span class="math inline">\(m_t^2\)</span> for each of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t^*_L {\widetilde}t_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R^* {\widetilde}t_R\)</span>. These come from <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms in the scalar potential of the form <span class="math inline">\(y_t^2 H_u^{0*} H_u^0 {\widetilde}t_L^* {\widetilde}t_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_t^2 H_u^{0*} H_u^0 {\widetilde}t_R^* {\widetilde}t_R\)</span> (see Figures [fig:stop]b and [fig:stop]c), with the Higgs fields replaced by their VEVs. (Of course, similar contributions are present for all of the squarks and sleptons, but they are too small to worry about except in the case of the top squarks.) Third, there are contributions to the scalar potential from <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(-\mu^* y_t {\widetilde}{{\overline}t} {\widetilde}t H_d^{0*} +{{{\rm c.c.}}}\)</span>; see eqs. ([striterms]) and Figure [fig:stri]a. These become <span class="math inline">\(-\mu^* v y_t \cos\beta\, {\widetilde}t^*_R {\widetilde}t_L + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(H_d^0\)</span> is replaced by its VEV. Finally, there are contributions to the scalar potential from the soft (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings <span class="math inline">\(a_t {\widetilde}{{\overline}t} {\widetilde}Q_3 H_u^0 + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\)</span> [see the first term of the second line of eq. ([MSSMsoft]), and eq. ([heavyatopapprox])], which become $ a_t v , {}t_L {}t_R^* + {{{}}}$ when <span class="math inline">\(H_u^0\)</span> is replaced by its VEV. Putting these all together, we have a squared-mass matrix for the top squarks, which in the gauge-eigenstate basis (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_R\)</span>) is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{{\cal L}}_{\mbox{stop masses}} =  -\pmatrix{{\widetilde}t_L^* &amp; {\widetilde}t_R^*}
{\bf m_{{\widetilde}t}^2} \pmatrix{{\widetilde}t_L \cr {\widetilde}t_R}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m_{{\widetilde}t}^2} =
\pmatrix{
m^2_{Q_3} + m_t^2 + \Delta_{\tilde u_L} &amp; 
v(a_t^* \sin\beta - \mu y_t\cos\beta )\cr
v (a_t \sin\beta - \mu^* y_t\cos\beta ) &amp; 
m^2_{{\overline}u_3} + m_t^2 + \Delta_{\tilde u_R}
} .
\label{mstopmatrix}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This hermitian matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix to give mass eigenstates: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\pmatrix{{\widetilde}t_1\cr{\widetilde}t_2} =
\pmatrix{ c_{\tilde t} &amp; -s_{\tilde t}^* \cr
          s_{\tilde t} &amp; c_{\tilde t}^*}
\pmatrix{{\widetilde}t_L \cr {\widetilde}t_R} .
\label{pixies}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\tilde t_1}&lt; m^2_{\tilde t_2}\)</span> are the eigenvalues of eq. ([mstopmatrix]), and <span class="math inline">\(|c_{\tilde t}|^2 + |s_{\tilde t}|^2 = 1\)</span>. If the off-diagonal elements of eq. ([mstopmatrix]) are real, then <span class="math inline">\(c_{\tilde t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{\tilde t}\)</span> are the cosine and sine of a stop mixing angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{\tilde t}\)</span>, which can be chosen in the range <span class="math inline">\(0\leq \theta_{\tilde t} &lt; \pi\)</span>. Because of the large RG effects proportional to <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> in eq. ([mq3rge]) and eq. ([mtbarrge]), in MSUGRA and GMSB and similar models one finds that <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\overline}u_3}^2 &lt; m_{Q_3}^2\)</span> at the electroweak scale, and both of these quantities are usually significantly smaller than the squark squared masses for the first two families. The diagonal terms <span class="math inline">\(m_t^2\)</span> in eq. ([mstopmatrix]) can mitigate this effect slightly, but only slightly, and the off-diagonal entries will typically induce a significant mixing, which always reduces the lighter top-squark squared-mass eigenvalue. Therefore, models often predict that <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1\)</span> is the lightest squark of all, and that it is predominantly <span class="math inline">\(\tilde t_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>A very similar analysis can be performed for the bottom squarks and charged tau sleptons, which in their respective gauge-eigenstate bases (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_R\)</span>) and (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>) have squared-mass matrices: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m_{{\widetilde}b}^2} =
\pmatrix{
m^2_{Q_3} + \Delta_{\tilde d_L} &amp; 
v (a_b^* \cos\beta - \mu y_b\sin\beta )\cr
v (a_b \cos\beta - \mu^* y_b\sin\beta ) &amp; 
m^2_{{\overline}d_3} + \Delta_{\tilde d_R} },
\label{msbottommatrix}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf m_{{\widetilde}\tau}^2} =
\pmatrix{
m^2_{L_3} + \Delta_{\tilde e_L} &amp; 
v (a_\tau^* \cos\beta -\mu y_\tau\sin\beta )\cr
v (a_\tau \cos\beta - \mu^* y_\tau\sin\beta ) &amp; 
m^2_{{\overline}e_3} + \Delta_{\tilde e_R}}.
\label{mstaumatrix}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> These can be diagonalized to give mass eigenstates <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_1, {\widetilde}b_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1, {\widetilde}\tau_2\)</span> in exact analogy with eq. ([pixies]).</p>
<p>The magnitude and importance of mixing in the sbottom and stau sectors depends on how big <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is. If <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is not too large (in practice, this usually means less than about <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> or so, depending on the situation under study), the sbottoms and staus do not get a very large effect from the mixing terms and the RG effects due to <span class="math inline">\(X_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_\tau\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(y_b,y_\tau \ll y_t\)</span> from eq. ([eq:ytbtaumtbtau]). In that case the mass eigenstates are very nearly the same as the gauge eigenstates <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>. The latter three, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\tau\)</span>, will be nearly degenerate with their first- and second-family counterparts with the same <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span> quantum numbers. However, even in the case of small <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_L\)</span> will feel the effects of the large top Yukawa coupling because it is part of the doublet containing <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_L\)</span>. In particular, from eq. ([mq3rge]) we see that <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> acts to decrease <span class="math inline">\(m_{Q_3}^2\)</span> as it is RG-evolved down from the input scale to the electroweak scale. Therefore the mass of <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}b_L}\)</span> can be significantly less than the masses of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}s_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>For larger values of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, the mixing in eqs. ([msbottommatrix]) and ([mstaumatrix]) can be quite significant, because <span class="math inline">\(y_b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_\tau\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_\tau\)</span> are non-negligible. Just as in the case of the top squarks, the lighter sbottom and stau mass eigenstates (denoted <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span>) can be significantly lighter than their first- and second-family counterparts. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}\nu_\tau}\)</span> can be significantly lighter than the nearly degenerate <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}\nu_e}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>The requirement that the third-family squarks and sleptons should all have positive squared masses implies limits on the magnitudes of <span class="math inline">\(a_t^*\sin\beta -\mu y_t \cos\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_b^*\cos\beta - \mu y_b \sin\beta\)</span> and and <span class="math inline">\(a_\tau^* \cos\beta - \mu y_\tau \sin\beta\)</span>. If they are too large, then the smaller eigenvalue of eq. ([mstopmatrix]), ([msbottommatrix]) or ([mstaumatrix]) will be driven negative, implying that a squark or charged slepton gets a VEV, breaking <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> or electromagnetism. Since this is clearly unacceptable, one can put bounds on the (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings, or equivalently on the parameter <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> in MSUGRA models. Even if all of the squared-mass eigenvalues are positive, the presence of large (scalar)<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> couplings can yield global minima of the scalar potential, with non-zero squark and/or charged slepton VEVs, which are disconnected from the vacuum that conserves <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C\)</span> and electromagnetism <span class="citation" data-cites="badvacua">@badvacua</span>. However, it is not always immediately clear whether the mere existence of such disconnected global minima should really disqualify a set of model parameters, because the tunneling rate from our “good” vacuum to the “bad” vacua can easily be longer than the age of the universe <span class="citation" data-cites="kusenko">@kusenko</span>.</p>
<p>Radiative corrections to the squark and slepton masses are potentially important, and are given at one-loop order in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="PBMZ">@PBMZ</span>. For squarks, the leading two-loop corrections have been found in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2005eg Martin:2006ub">@Martin:2005eg [@Martin:2006ub]</span>, and are implemented in the latest version of the <span>SOFTSUSY</span> code <span class="citation" data-cites="SOFTSUSY">@SOFTSUSY</span>.</p>

<p>A complete set of Feynman rules for the interactions of these particles with each other and with the Standard Model quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons can be found in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="HaberKanereview GunionHaber">@HaberKanereview [@GunionHaber]</span>. Feynman rules based on two-component spinor notation have also been given in <span class="citation" data-cites="DHM">@DHM</span>.</p>
<p>Specific models for the soft terms can predict the masses and the mixing angles angles for the MSSM in terms of far fewer parameters. For example, in the MSUGRA models, the only free parameters not already measured by experiment are <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. In GMSB models, the free parameters include the scale <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, the messenger mass scale <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess}\)</span>, the integer number <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span> of copies of the minimal messengers, the goldstino decay constant $F $, and the Higgs mass parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>After RG evolving the soft terms down to the electroweak scale, one can demand that the scalar potential gives correct electroweak symmetry breaking. This allows us to trade <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> for one parameter <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, as in eqs. ([mubsub1])-([mubsub2]). So, to a reasonable approximation, the entire mass spectrum in MSUGRA models is determined by only five unknown parameters: <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, and Arg(<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), while in the simplest gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models one can pick parameters <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span>, $F $, <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, and Arg(<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>). Both frameworks are highly predictive. Of course, it is quite likely that the essential physics of supersymmetry breaking is not captured by either of these two scenarios in their minimal forms.</p>
<p>Figure [fig:running] shows the RG running of scalar and gaugino masses in a sample model based on the MSUGRA boundary conditions imposed at <span class="math inline">\(Q_0 = 1.5\times 10^{16}\)</span> GeV.</p>
<p>[The parameter values used for this illustration were <span class="math inline">\(m_0 = 300\)</span> GeV, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2} = -A_0 = 1000\)</span> GeV, <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta = 15\)</span>, and sign(<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>)<span class="math inline">\(=+\)</span>, but these values were chosen more for their artistic value in Figure [fig:running], and not as an attempt at realism. The goal here is to understand the qualitative trends, rather than guess the correct numerical values.] The running gaugino masses are solid lines labeled by <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span>. The dot-dashed lines labeled <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span> are the running values of the quantities <span class="math inline">\((\mu^2 + m_{H_u}^2)^{1/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(({\mu^2 + m_{H_d}^2})^{1/2}\)</span>, which appear in the Higgs potential. The other lines are the running squark and slepton masses, with dashed lines for the square roots of the third family parameters <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{{\overline}d_3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{Q_3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{{\overline}u_3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{L_3}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{{\overline}e_3}\)</span> (from top to bottom), and solid lines for the first and second family sfermions. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\mu^2 + m_{H_u}^2\)</span> runs negative because of the effects of the large top Yukawa coupling as discussed above, providing for electroweak symmetry breaking. At the electroweak scale, the values of the Lagrangian soft parameters can be used to extract the physical masses, cross-sections, and decay widths of the particles, and other observables such as dark matter abundances and rare process rates. There are a variety of publicly available programs that do these tasks, including radiative corrections; see for example <span class="citation" data-cites="ISAJET">@ISAJET</span><span class="citation" data-cites="micrOMEGAs">@micrOMEGAs</span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="FeynHiggs">@FeynHiggs</span>.</p>
<p>Figure [fig:sample] shows deliberately qualitative sketches of sample MSSM mass spectrum obtained from four different types of models assumptions.</p>
<p>The first, in Figure [fig:sample](a), is the output from an MSUGRA model with relatively low <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> compared to <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{1/2}\)</span> (similar to fig. [fig:running]). This model features a near-decoupling limit for the Higgs sector, and a bino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> LSP, nearly degenerate wino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2, {\widetilde}C_1\)</span>, and higgsino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_3, {\widetilde}N_4, {\widetilde}C_2\)</span>. The gluino is the heaviest superpartner. The squarks are all much heavier than the sleptons, and the lightest sfermion is a stau. (The second-family squarks and sleptons are nearly degenerate with those of the first family, and so are not shown separately.) Variations in the model parameters have important and predictable effects. For example, taking larger values of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> with other model parameters held fixed will usually tend to lower <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> masses compared to those of the other sparticles. Taking larger <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> will tend to squeeze together the spectrum of squarks and sleptons and move them all higher compared to the neutralinos, charginos and gluino. This is illustrated in Figure [fig:sample](b), which instead has <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2 \gg m_{1/2}^2\)</span>. In this model, the heaviest chargino and neutralino are wino-like.</p>
<p>The third sample sketch, in fig. [fig:sample](c), is obtained from a typical minimal GMSB model, with <span class="math inline">\(N_5 = 1\)</span> Here we see that the hierarchy between strongly interacting sparticles and weakly interacting ones is quite large. Changing the messenger scale or <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> does not reduce the relative splitting between squark and slepton masses, because there is no analog of the universal <span class="math inline">\(m_0^2\)</span> contribution here. Increasing the number of messenger fields tends to decrease the squark and slepton masses relative to the gaugino masses, but still keeps the hierarchy between squark and slepton masses intact. In the model shown, the LSP is the nearly massless gravitino and the NLSP is a bino-like neutralino, but for larger number of messenger fields it could be either a stau, or else co-NLSPs <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \tau_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \mu_L\)</span>, depending on the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fourth sample sketch, in fig. [fig:sample](d), is of a typical GMSB model with a non-minimal messenger sector, <span class="math inline">\(N_5=3\)</span> Again the LSP is the nearly massless gravitino, but this time the NLSP is the lightest stau. The heaviest superpartner is the gluino, and the heaviest chargino and neutralino are wino-like.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to rely too heavily on specific scenarios for the MSSM mass and mixing spectrum, and the above illustrations are only a tiny fraction of the available possibilities. However, it is also useful to keep in mind some general trends that often recur in various different models. Indeed, there has emerged a sort of folklore concerning likely features of the MSSM spectrum, partly based on theoretical bias and partly on the constraints inherent in many known viable softly-broken supersymmetric theories. We remark on these features mainly because they represent the prevailing prejudices among many supersymmetry theorists, which is certainly a useful thing to know even if one wisely decides to remain skeptical. For example, it is perhaps not unlikely that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The LSP is the lightest neutralino <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span>, unless the gravitino is lighter or <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is not conserved. If <span class="math inline">\(M_1 &lt; M_2,|\mu|\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is likely to be bino-like, with a mass roughly 0.5 times the masses of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> in many well-motivated models. If, instead, <span class="math inline">\(|\mu| &lt; M_1,M_2\)</span>, then the LSP <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> has a large higgsino content and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> are not much heavier. And, if <span class="math inline">\(M_2 \ll M_1, |\mu|\)</span>, then the LSP will be a wino-like neutralino, with a chargino only very slightly heavier.</p></li>
<li><p>The gluino will be much heavier than the lighter neutralinos and charginos. This is certainly true in the case of the “standard” gaugino mass relation eq. ([gauginomassunification]); more generally, the running gluino mass parameter grows relatively quickly as it is RG-evolved into the infrared because the QCD coupling is larger than the electroweak gauge couplings. So even if there are big corrections to the gaugino mass boundary conditions eqs. ([gauginounificationsugra]) or ([gauginogmsb]), the gluino mass parameter <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span> is likely to come out larger than <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The squarks of the first and second families are nearly degenerate and much heavier than the sleptons. This is because each squark mass gets the same large positive-definite radiative corrections from loops involving the gluino. The left-handed squarks <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}s_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}c_L\)</span> are likely to be heavier than their right-handed counterparts <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}u_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}d_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}s_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}c_R\)</span>, because of the effect parameterized by <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> in eqs. ([msdlform])-([mserform]).</p></li>
<li><p>The squarks of the first two families cannot be lighter than about 0.8 times the mass of the gluino in MSUGRA models, and about 0.6 times the mass of the gluino in the simplest gauge-mediated models as discussed in section [subsec:origins.gmsb] if the number of messenger squark pairs is <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\leq 4\)</span>. In the MSUGRA case this is because the gluino mass feeds into the squark masses through RG evolution; in the gauge-mediated case it is because the gluino and squark masses are tied together by eqs. ([gauginogmsbgen]) and ([scalargmsbgen]).</p></li>
<li><p>The lighter stop <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1\)</span> and the lighter sbottom <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_1\)</span> are probably the lightest squarks. This is because stop and sbottom mixing effects and the effects of <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_b\)</span> in eqs. ([mq3rge])-([md3rge]) both tend to decrease the lighter stop and sbottom masses.</p></li>
<li><p>The lightest charged slepton is probably a stau <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span>. The mass difference <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde e_R}-m_{\tilde \tau_1}\)</span> is likely to be significant if <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is large, because of the effects of a large tau Yukawa coupling. For smaller <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> is predominantly <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span> and it is not so much lighter than <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The left-handed charged sleptons <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_L\)</span> are likely to be heavier than their right-handed counterparts <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>. This is because of the effect of <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> in eq. ([mselform]). (Note also that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\tilde e_L} - \Delta_{\tilde e_R}\)</span> is positive but very small because of the numerical accident <span class="math inline">\(\sin^2\theta_W \approx 1/4\)</span>.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be kept in mind that each of these prejudices might be defied by the real world. The most important point is that by measuring the masses and mixing angles of the MSSM particles we will be able to gain a great deal of information that differentiate between competing proposals for the origin and mediation of supersymmetry breaking.</p>
<h1 id="sec:decays"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Sparticle decays</h1>
<p>This section contains a brief qualitative overview of the decay patterns of sparticles in the MSSM, assuming that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is conserved. We will consider in turn the possible decays of neutralinos, charginos, sleptons, squarks, and the gluino. If, as is most often assumed, the lightest neutralino <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is the LSP, then all decay chains will end up with it in the final state. Section [subsec:decays.gravitino] discusses the alternative possibility that the gravitino/goldstino <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}G}\)</span> is the LSP. For the sake of simplicity of notation, we will often not distinguish between particle and antiparticle names and labels in this section, with context and consistency (dictated by charge and color conservation) resolving any ambiguities.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:decays.inos"><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Decays of neutralinos and charginos</h2>
<p>Let us first consider the possible two-body decays. Each neutralino and chargino contains at least a small admixture of the electroweak gauginos <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^\pm\)</span>, as we saw in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.inos]. So, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_i\)</span> inherit couplings of weak interaction strength to (scalar, fermion) pairs, as shown in Figure [fig:gaugino]b,c. If sleptons or squarks are sufficiently light, a neutralino or chargino can therefore decay into lepton+slepton or quark+squark. To the extent that sleptons are probably lighter than squarks, the lepton+slepton final states are favored. A neutralino or chargino may also decay into any lighter neutralino or chargino plus a Higgs scalar or an electroweak gauge boson, because they inherit the gaugino-higgsino-Higgs (see Figure [fig:gaugino]b,c) and <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gaugino-gaugino-vector boson (see Figure [fig:gauge]c) couplings of their components. So, the possible two-body decay modes for neutralinos and charginos in the MSSM are: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}N_i \rightarrow
Z{\widetilde}N_j,\&gt;\&gt;\, W{\widetilde}C_j,\&gt;\&gt;\, h^0{\widetilde}N_j,\&gt;\&gt;\, \ell {\widetilde}\ell,\&gt;\&gt;\,

q{\widetilde}q^\prime],
\qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{cino2body}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> using a generic notation <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> for neutrinos, charged leptons, and quarks. The final states in brackets are the more kinematically implausible ones. (Since <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV, it is the most likely of the Higgs scalars to appear in these decays.) For the heavier neutralinos and chargino (<span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_2\)</span>), one or more of the two-body decays in eqs. ([nino2body]) and ([cino2body]) is likely to be kinematically allowed. Also, if the decays of neutralinos and charginos with a significant higgsino content into third-family quark-squark pairs are open, they can be greatly enhanced by the top-quark Yukawa coupling, following from the interactions shown in fig. [fig:topYukawa]b,c.</p>
<p>It may be that all of these two-body modes are kinematically forbidden for a given chargino or neutralino, especially for <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> decays. In that case, they have three-body decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

{\widetilde}C_2 \rightarrow f f {\widetilde}C_1,\qquad\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{}
\label{cino3body}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> through the same (but now off-shell) gauge bosons, Higgs scalars, sleptons, and squarks that appeared in the two-body decays eqs. ([nino2body]) and ([cino2body]). Here <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is generic notation for a lepton or quark, with <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f^\prime\)</span> distinct members of the same <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> multiplet (and of course one of the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;\)</span> in each of these decays must actually be an antifermion). The chargino and neutralino decay widths into the various final states can be found in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="inodecays">@inodecays</span><span class="citation" data-cites="neutralinoloopdecays">@neutralinoloopdecays</span>.</p>
<p>The Feynman diagrams for the neutralino and chargino decays with <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> in the final state that seem most likely to be important are shown in figure [fig:NCdecays].</p>
<p>         </p>
<p>         </p>
<p>In many situations, the decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}C_1^\pm \rightarrow \ell^\pm \nu {\widetilde}N_1,\qquad\quad
{\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- {\widetilde}N_1
\label{eq:CNleptonic}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> can be particularly important for phenomenology, because the leptons in the final state might result in clean signals. These decays are more likely if the intermediate sleptons are relatively light, even if they cannot be on-shell. Unfortunately, the enhanced mixing of staus, common in models, may well result in larger branching fractions for both <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde C_1\)</span> into final states with taus, rather than electrons or muons. This is one reason why good tau identification may be very helpful in attempts to discover and study supersymmetry.</p>
<p>In other situations, decays without isolated leptons in the final state are more useful, so that one will not need to contend with background events with missing energy coming from leptonic <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> boson decays in Standard Model processes. Then the decays of interest are the ones with quark partons in the final state, leading to <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}C_1 \rightarrow jj {\widetilde}N_1,\qquad\quad
{\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow jj {\widetilde}N_1,
\label{eq:CNjetdecays}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> means a jet. If the second of these decays goes through an on-shell <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span>, then these will usually be <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-jets that reconstruct an invariant mass consistent with 125 GeV.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:decays.sleptons"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Slepton decays</h2>
<p>Sleptons can have two-body decays into a lepton and a chargino or neutralino, because of their gaugino admixture, as may be seen directly from the couplings in Figures [fig:gaugino]b,c. Therefore, the two-body decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}N_i,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\,
{\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \nu {\widetilde}C_i,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\,
{\widetilde}\nu \rightarrow \nu {\widetilde}N_i,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\,
{\widetilde}\nu \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}C_i\end{eqnarray}\]</span> can be of weak interaction strength. In particular, the direct decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}N_1
\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{\rm and}\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;
{\widetilde}\nu \rightarrow \nu {\widetilde}N_1
\label{sleptonrightdecay}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> are (almost<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>) always kinematically allowed if <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is the LSP. However, if the sleptons are sufficiently heavy, then the two-body decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \nu {\widetilde}C_{1}
,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\,
{\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}N_{2}
,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\,
{\widetilde}\nu \rightarrow \nu {\widetilde}N_{2}
,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;{\rm and}\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;
{\widetilde}\nu \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}C_{1}
\label{sleptonleftdecay}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> can be important. The right-handed sleptons do not have a coupling to the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gauginos, so they typically prefer the direct decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell_R \rightarrow \ell{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is bino-like. In contrast, the left-handed sleptons may prefer to decay as in eq. ([sleptonleftdecay]) rather than the direct decays to the LSP as in eq. ([sleptonrightdecay]), if the former is kinematically open and if <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> are mostly wino. This is because the slepton-lepton-wino interactions in Figure [fig:gaugino]b are proportional to the <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gauge coupling <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, whereas the slepton-lepton-bino interactions in Figure [fig:gaugino]c are proportional to the much smaller <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> coupling <span class="math inline">\(g^\prime\)</span>. Formulas for these decay widths can be found in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="epprod">@epprod</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:decays.squarks"><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Squark decays</h2>
<p>If the decay $ {}q q{}g $ is kinematically allowed, it will usually dominate, because the quark-squark-gluino vertex in Figure <span>[fig:gaugino]</span>a has QCD strength. Otherwise, the squarks can decay into a quark plus neutralino or chargino: $ {}q q {}N_i$ or $ q^C_i $. The direct decay to the LSP <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow q {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is always kinematically favored, and for right-handed squarks it can dominate if <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is mostly bino. However, the left-handed squarks may strongly prefer to decay into heavier charginos or neutralinos instead, for example <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow q {\widetilde}N_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(q^\prime {\widetilde}C_1\)</span>, because the relevant squark-quark-wino couplings are much bigger than the squark-quark-bino couplings. Squark decays to higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos are less important, except in the cases of stops and sbottoms, which have sizable Yukawa couplings. The gluino, chargino or neutralino resulting from the squark decay will in turn decay, and so on, until a final state containing <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is reached. This results in numerous and complicated decay chain possibilities called cascade decays <span class="citation" data-cites="cascades">@cascades</span>.</p>
<p>It is possible that the decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1 \rightarrow t{\widetilde}g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1 \rightarrow t {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> are both kinematically forbidden. If so, then the lighter top squark may decay only into charginos, by <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1 \rightarrow b {\widetilde}C_1\)</span>, or by a three-body decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1 \rightarrow b W {\widetilde}N_1\)</span>. If even this decay is kinematically closed, then it has only the flavor-suppressed decay to a charm quark, $ {}t_1c {}N_1$, and the four-body decay $ {}t_1bff’ {}N_1 $. These decays can be very slow <span class="citation" data-cites="stoptocharmdecay">@stoptocharmdecay</span>, so that the lightest stop can be quasi-stable on the time scale relevant for collider physics, and can hadronize into bound states.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:decays.gluino"><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Gluino decays</h2>
<p>The decay of the gluino can only proceed through a squark, either on-shell or virtual. If two-body decays $ {}g q{}q $ are open, they will dominate, again because the relevant gluino-quark-squark coupling in Figure [fig:gaugino]a has QCD strength. Since the top and bottom squarks can easily be much lighter than all of the other squarks, it is quite possible that $ {}g t {}t_1$ and/or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}g \rightarrow b {\widetilde}b_1\)</span> are the only available two-body decay mode(s) for the gluino, in which case they will dominate over all others. If instead all of the squarks are heavier than the gluino, the gluino will decay only through off-shell squarks, so $ {}g q q {}N_i$ and $ q q^C_i $. The squarks, neutralinos and charginos in these final states will then decay as discussed above, so there can be many competing gluino decay chains. Some of the possibilities are shown in fig. [fig:gluinocascades].</p>
<p>The cascade decays can have final-state branching fractions that are individually small and quite sensitive to the model parameters.</p>
<p>The simplest gluino decays, including the ones shown in fig. [fig:gluinocascades], can have 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons (in addition to two or more hadronic jets) in the final state. An important feature is that when there is exactly one charged lepton, it can have either charge with exactly equal probability. This follows from the fact that the gluino is a Majorana fermion, and does not “know” about electric charge; for each diagram with a given lepton charge, there is always an equal one with every particle replaced by its antiparticle.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:decays.gravitino"><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Decays to the gravitino/goldstino</h2>
<p>Most phenomenological studies of supersymmetry assume explicitly or implicitly that the lightest neutralino is the LSP. This is typically the case in gravity-mediated models for the soft terms. However, in gauge-mediated models (and in “no-scale” models), the LSP is instead the gravitino. As we saw in section [subsec:origins.gravitino], a very light gravitino may be relevant for collider phenomenology, because it contains as its longitudinal component the goldstino, which has a non-gravitational coupling to all sparticle-particle pairs <span class="math inline">\(({\widetilde}X, X\)</span>). The decay rate found in eq. ([generalgravdecay]) for <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X\rightarrow X{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> is usually not fast enough to compete with the other decays of sparticles <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X\)</span> as mentioned above, <span><em>except</em></span> in the case that <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}X\)</span> is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Since the NLSP has no competing decays, it should always decay into its superpartner and the LSP gravitino.</p>
<p>In principle, any of the MSSM superpartners could be the NLSP in models with a light goldstino, but most models with gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking have either a neutralino or a charged lepton playing this role. The argument for this can be seen immediately from eqs. ([gauginogmsbgen]) and ([scalargmsbgen]); since <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1 &lt; \alpha_2,\alpha_3\)</span>, those superpartners with only <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> interactions will tend to get the smallest masses. The gauge-eigenstate sparticles with this property are the bino and the right-handed sleptons <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_R\)</span>, so the appropriate corresponding mass eigenstates should be plausible candidates for the NLSP.</p>
<p>First suppose that <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is the NLSP in light goldstino models. Since <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> contains an admixture of the photino (the linear combination of bino and neutral wino whose superpartner is the photon), from eq. ([generalgravdecay]) it decays into photon + goldstino/gravitino with a partial width <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Gamma ({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow \gamma {{\widetilde}G}) \,=\,
2\times 10^{-3} \&gt; \kappa_{1\gamma}\left ({m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}\over 100\&gt;\rm{
GeV}}\right )^5
\left ( {\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\over 100\&gt;{\rm TeV}} \right )^{-4} \&gt;
{\rm eV}.\qquad{}
\label{neutralinodecaywidth}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{1\gamma} \equiv |{\bf N}_{11}\cos\theta_W + {\bf N}_{12}\sin \theta_W |^2\)</span> is the “photino content” of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span>, in terms of the neutralino mixing matrix <span class="math inline">\({\bf N}_{ij}\)</span> defined by eq. ([diagmN]). We have normalized <span class="math inline">\(m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\)</span> to (very roughly) minimum expected values in gauge-mediated models. This width is much smaller than for a typical flavor-unsuppressed weak interaction decay, but it is still large enough to allow <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> to decay before it has left a collider detector, if <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F\rangle}\)</span> is less than a few thousand TeV in gauge-mediated models, or equivalently if <span class="math inline">\(m_{3/2}\)</span> is less than a keV or so when eq. ([gravitinomass]) holds. In fact, from eq. ([neutralinodecaywidth]), the mean decay length of an <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> with energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in the lab frame is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
d = 9.9 \times 10^{-3}\&gt; {1\over \kappa_{1\gamma}}\,
({E^2/ m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}^2} - 1)^{1/2}
\left ({m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}\over 100\&gt;\rm{ GeV}}\right )^{-5}
\left({\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\over 100\&gt;{\rm TeV}} \right )^{4}
\&gt;{\rm cm},
\label{neutralinodecaylength}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which could be anything from sub-micron to multi-kilometer, depending on the scale of supersymmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\)</span>. (In other models that have a gravitino LSP, including certain “no-scale” models <span class="citation" data-cites="noscalephotons">@noscalephotons</span>, the same formulas apply with <span class="math inline">\({\langle F \rangle} \rightarrow \sqrt{3} m_{3/2} {M_{\rm P}}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Of course, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is not a pure photino, but contains also admixtures of the superpartner of the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> boson and the neutral Higgs scalars. So, one can also have <span class="citation" data-cites="DDRT">@DDRT</span> <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow Z{{\widetilde}G}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h^0{{\widetilde}G}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A^0{{\widetilde}G}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(H^0{{\widetilde}G}\)</span>, with decay widths given in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="AKKMM2">@AKKMM2</span>. Of these decays, the last two are unlikely to be kinematically allowed, and only the <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow \gamma{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> mode is guaranteed to be kinematically allowed for a gravitino LSP. Furthermore, even if they are open, the decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1 \rightarrow Z{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1 \rightarrow h^0 {{\widetilde}G}\)</span> are subject to strong kinematic suppressions proportional to <span class="math inline">\((1-m_Z^2/m_{{\widetilde}N_1}^2)^4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1 - m_{h^0}^2/m_{{\widetilde}N_1}^2)^4\)</span>, respectively, in view of eq. ([generalgravdecay]). Still, these decays may play an important role in phenomenology if <span class="math inline">\({\langle F\rangle }\)</span> is not too large, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> has a sizable zino or higgsino content, and <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is significantly greater than <span class="math inline">\(m_Z\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A charged slepton makes another likely candidate for the NLSP. Actually, more than one slepton can act effectively as the NLSP, even though one of them is slightly lighter, if they are sufficiently close in mass so that each has no kinematically allowed decays except to the goldstino. In GMSB models, the squared masses obtained by <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_R\)</span> are equal because of the flavor-blindness of the gauge couplings. However, this is not the whole story, because one must take into account mixing with <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_L\)</span> and renormalization group running. These effects are very small for <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R\)</span> because of the tiny electron and muon Yukawa couplings, so we can quite generally treat them as degenerate, unmixed mass eigenstates. In contrast, <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_R\)</span> usually has a quite significant mixing with <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_L\)</span>, proportional to the tau Yukawa coupling. This means that the lighter stau mass eigenstate <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_1\)</span> is pushed lower in mass than <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R\)</span>, by an amount that depends most strongly on <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is not too large then the stau mixing effect leaves the slepton mass eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_1\)</span> degenerate to within less than $m_1.8 $ GeV, so they act effectively as co-NLSPs. In particular, this means that even though the stau is slightly lighter, the three-body slepton decays <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R \rightarrow e\tau^\pm\widetilde \tau_1^\mp\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R \rightarrow \mu\tau^\pm\widetilde \tau_1^\mp\)</span> are not kinematically allowed; the only allowed decays for the three lightest sleptons are <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\rightarrow e {{\widetilde}G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R \rightarrow \mu{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau {{\widetilde}G}\)</span>. This situation is called the “slepton co-NLSP” scenario.</p>
<p>For larger values of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, the lighter stau eigenstate <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> is more than <span class="math inline">\(1.8\)</span> GeV lighter than <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>. This means that the decays <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow \tau{\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde e_R \rightarrow e \tau {\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \mu_R \rightarrow \mu \tau {\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> are open. Then <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde \tau_1\)</span> is the sole NLSP, with all other MSSM supersymmetric particles having kinematically allowed decays into it. This is called the “stau NLSP” scenario.</p>
<p>In any case, a slepton NLSP can decay like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell {{\widetilde}G}\)</span> according to eq. ([generalgravdecay]), with a width and decay length just given by eqs. ([neutralinodecaywidth]) and ([neutralinodecaylength]) with the replacements <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{1\gamma} \rightarrow 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\widetilde}N_1} \rightarrow m_{{\widetilde}\ell}\)</span>. So, as for the neutralino NLSP case, the decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> can be either fast or very slow, depending on the scale of supersymmetry breaking.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\)</span> is larger than roughly <span class="math inline">\(10^3\)</span> TeV (or the gravitino is heavier than a keV or so), then the NLSP is so long-lived that it will usually escape a typical collider detector. If <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is the NLSP, then, it might as well be the LSP from the point of view of collider physics. However, the decay of <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> into the gravitino is still important for cosmology, since an unstable <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is clearly not a good dark matter candidate while the gravitino LSP conceivably could be. On the other hand, if the NLSP is a long-lived charged slepton, then one can see its tracks (or possibly decay kinks) inside a collider detector <span class="citation" data-cites="DDRT">@DDRT</span>. The presence of a massive charged NLSP can be established by measuring an anomalously long time-of-flight or high ionization rate for a track in the detector.</p>
<h1 id="sec:signals"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Experimental signals for supersymmetry</h1>
<p>So far, the experimental study of supersymmetry has unfortunately been confined to setting limits. As we have already remarked in section [subsec:mssm.hints], there can be indirect signals for supersymmetry from processes that are rare or forbidden in the Standard Model but have contributions from sparticle loops. These include <span class="math inline">\(\mu\rightarrow e\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\rightarrow s\gamma\)</span>, neutral meson mixing, electric dipole moments for the neutron and the electron, etc. There are also virtual sparticle effects on Standard Model predictions like <span class="math inline">\(R_b\)</span> (the fraction of hadronic <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> decays with <span class="math inline">\(b\overline b\)</span> pairs) <span class="citation" data-cites="Rb">@Rb</span> and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon <span class="citation" data-cites="muonmoment">@muonmoment</span>, which exclude some models that would otherwise be viable. Extensions of the MSSM (including, but not limited, to GUTs) can quite easily predict proton decay and neutron-antineutron oscillations at potentially observable rates, even if <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is exactly conserved. However, it would be impossible to ascribe a positive result for any of these processes to supersymmetry in an unambiguous way. There is no substitute for the direct detection of sparticles and verification of their quantum numbers and interactions. In this section we will give an incomplete and qualitative review of some of the possible signals for direct detection of supersymmetry. LHC data and analyses are presently advancing this subject at a very high rate, so that any detailed and specific discussion would be obsolete on a time scale of weeks or months. The most recent experimental results from the LHC are available at the ATLAS and CMS physics results web pages.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:signals.TEVLHC"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Signals at hadron colliders</h2>
<p>At this writing, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has already excluded significant chunks of supersymmetric parameter space, based on proton-proton collisions amounting to about 5 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 7\)</span> TeV, 20 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 8\)</span> TeV, and 4 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 13\)</span> TeV. In many MSUGRA and similar models, gluinos and squarks with masses well above 1 TeV are already excluded by LHC data, superseding the results from the CDF and D<span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> detectors at the Fermilab Tevatron <span class="math inline">\(p\overline p\)</span> collider with <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 1.96\)</span> TeV. Future planned increases in LHC integrated luminosity suggest that if supersymmetry is the solution to the hierarchy problem discussed in the Introduction, then the LHC has a good chance of finding direct evidence for it within the next few years.</p>

<p>The reactions in ([eq:qqbarinos]) and ([eq:qqbarsleptons]) get contributions from electroweak vector bosons in the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel, and those in ([eq:qqbarinos]) also have <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel squark-exchange contributions that are of lesser importance in most models. The processes in ([eq:gluegluegluinos])-([eq:qqsquarks]) get contributions from the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel exchange of an appropriate squark or gluino, and ([eq:gluegluegluinos]) and ([eq:qqbargluinosorsquarks]) also have gluon <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel contributions. In a crude first approximation, for the hard parton collisions needed to make heavy particles, one may think of the Tevatron as a quark-antiquark collider, and the LHC as a gluon-gluon and gluon-quark collider. However, the signals are always an inclusive combination of the results of parton collisions of all types, and generally cannot be neatly separated.</p>
<p>At the Tevatron collider, the chargino and neutralino production processes (mediated primarily by valence quark annihilation into virtual weak bosons) tended to have the larger cross-sections, unless the squarks or gluino were rather light (less than 300 GeV or so, which is now clearly ruled out by the LHC). In a typical model where <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> are mostly <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gauginos and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is mostly bino, the largest production cross-sections in ([eq:qqbarinos]) belong to the <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^+{\widetilde}C_1^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1{\widetilde}N_2\)</span> channels, because they have significant couplings to <span class="math inline">\(\gamma,Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> bosons, respectively, and because of kinematics. At the LHC, the situation is typically reversed, with production of gluinos and squarks by gluon-gluon and gluon-quark fusion usually dominating. At both colliders, one can also have associated production of a chargino or neutralino together with a squark or gluino, but most models predict that the cross-sections (of mixed electroweak and QCD strength) are much lower than for the ones in ([eq:qqbarinos])-([eq:qqsquarks]). Slepton pair production as in ([eq:qqbarsleptons]) was quite small at the Tevatron, but might be observable eventually at the LHC <span class="citation" data-cites="sleptonLHC">@sleptonLHC</span>. Cross-sections for sparticle production at hadron colliders can be found in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="gluinosquarkproduction">@gluinosquarkproduction</span>, and have been incorporated in computer programs including <span class="citation" data-cites="ISAJET">@ISAJET</span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="PYTHIA">@PYTHIA</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Alwall:2011uj">@Alwall:2011uj</span>.</p>
<p>The decays of the produced sparticles result in final states with two neutralino LSPs, which escape the detector. The LSPs carry away at least <span class="math inline">\(2 m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}\)</span> of missing energy, but at hadron colliders only the component of the missing energy that is manifest as momenta transverse to the colliding beams, usually denoted <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_T^{\rm miss}\)</span> (although <span class="math inline">\(\vec{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>p<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} p \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>p<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}_T\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_T^{\hspace{1.5pt}\rm miss}\)</span> might be more logical names) is observable. So, in general the observable signals for supersymmetry at hadron colliders are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> leptons + <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> jets + <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>, where either <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> might be 0. There are important Standard Model backgrounds to these signals, especially from processes involving production of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> bosons that decay to neutrinos, which provide the <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>. Therefore it is important to identify specific signal region cuts for which the backgrounds can be reduced. Of course, the optimal choice of cuts depends on which sparticles are being produced and how they decay, facts that are not known in advance. Depending on the specific object of the search, backgrounds can be further reduced by requiring at least some number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of energetic jets, and imposing a cut on a variable <span class="math inline">\(H_T\)</span>, typically defined to be the sum of the largest few (or all) of the <span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span>’s of the jets and leptons in each event. (Unfortunately, there is no standard definition of <span class="math inline">\(H_T\)</span>.) Different signal regions can be defined by how many jets are required in the event, the minimum <span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span> cuts on those jets, how many jets are included in the definition of <span class="math inline">\(H_T\)</span>, and other fine details. Alternatively, one can cut on <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm eff} \equiv H_T + {{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(H_T\)</span>. Another cut that is often used in searches is to require a minimum value for the ratio of <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> to either <span class="math inline">\(H_T\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm eff}\)</span>; the backgrounds tend to have smaller values of this ratio than a supersymmetric signal would. LHC searches have also made use of more sophisticated kinematic observables, such as <span class="math inline">\(M_{T2}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="MT2">@MT2</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_T\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="alphaT">@alphaT</span>, and razor variables <span class="citation" data-cites="razor">@razor</span>.</p>
<p>The classic <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> signal for supersymmetry at hadron colliders is events with jets and <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> but no energetic isolated leptons. The latter requirement reduces backgrounds from Standard Model processes with leptonic <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> decays, and is obviously most effective if the relevant sparticle decays have sizable branching fractions into channels with no leptons in the final state. The most important potential backgrounds are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>detector mismeasurements of jet energies,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>+jets, with the <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> decaying to <span class="math inline">\(\ell\nu\)</span>, when the charged lepton is missed or absorbed into a jet,</p></li>

<li><p><span class="math inline">\(t\overline t\)</span> production, with <span class="math inline">\(W\rightarrow \ell\nu\)</span>, when the charged lepton is missed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One must choose the <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> cut high enough to reduce these backgrounds, and also to assist in efficient triggering. Requiring at least one very high-<span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span> jet can also satisfy a trigger requirement. In addition, the first (QCD) background can be reduced by requiring that the transverse direction of the <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> is not too close to the transverse direction of a jet. The jets<span class="math inline">\(+{{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> signature is a favorite possibility for the first evidence for supersymmetry to be found at the LHC. It can get important contributions from every type of sparticle pair production, except slepton pair production.</p>
<p>Another important possibility for the LHC is the single lepton plus jets plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> signal <span class="citation" data-cites="LHCdiscovery">@LHCdiscovery</span>. It has a potentially large Standard Model background from production of <span class="math inline">\(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\)</span>, either together with jets or from top decays. However, this background can be reduced by putting a cut on the transverse mass variable <span class="math inline">\(m_T = \sqrt{2 p_T^\ell {{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}[1 - \cos(\Delta \phi)]}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \phi\)</span> is the difference in azimuthal angle between the missing transverse momentum and the lepton. For <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> decays, this is essentially always less than 100 GeV even after detector resolution effects, so a cut requiring <span class="math inline">\(m_T &gt; 100\)</span> GeV nearly eliminates those background contributions at the LHC. The single lepton plus jets signal can have an extremely large rate from various sparticle production modes, and may give a good discovery or confirmation signal at the LHC.</p>
<p>The same-charge dilepton signal <span class="citation" data-cites="likesigndilepton">@likesigndilepton</span> has the advantage of relatively small backgrounds. It can occur if the gluino decays with a significant branching fraction to hadrons plus a chargino, which can subsequently decay into a final state with a charged lepton, a neutrino, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span>. Since the gluino doesn’t know anything about electric charge, the charged lepton produced from each gluino decay can have either sign with equal probability, as discussed in section [subsec:decays.gluino]. This means that gluino pair production or gluino-squark production will often lead to events with two leptons with the same charge (and uncorrelated flavors) plus jets and <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>. This signal can also arise from squark pair production, for example if the squarks decay like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q \rightarrow q{\widetilde}g\)</span>. The physics backgrounds at hadron colliders are very small, because the largest Standard Model sources for isolated lepton pairs, notably Drell-Yan, <span class="math inline">\(W^+W^-\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t\overline t\)</span> production, can only yield opposite-charge dileptons. Despite the backgrounds just mentioned, opposite-charge dilepton signals, for example from slepton pair production, or slepton-rich decays of heavier superpartners, with subsequent decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell {{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>, may also eventually give an observable signal at the LHC.</p>
<p>The trilepton signal <span class="citation" data-cites="trilepton">@trilepton</span> is another possible discovery mode, featuring three leptons plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>, and possibly hadronic jets. At the Tevatron, this would most likely have come about from electroweak <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1{\widetilde}N_2\)</span> production followed by the decays indicated in eq. ([eq:CNleptonic]), in which case high-<span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span> hadronic activity should be absent in the event. A typical Feynman diagram for such an event is shown in fig. [fig:trilepton]. It could also come from <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}g{\widetilde}g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q{\widetilde}g\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q {\widetilde}q\)</span> production, with one of the gluinos or squarks decaying through a <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> and the other through a <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> in a variety of different ways.</p>

<p>This is the more likely origin at the LHC, at least in most benchmarks based on MSUGRA or similar models. In that case, there will be very high-<span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span> jets from the decays, in addition to the three leptons and <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>. These signatures rely on the <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> having a significant branching fraction for the three-body decay to leptons in eq. ([eq:CNleptonic]). The competing two-body decay modes <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow h^0 {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow Z {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> are sometimes called “spoiler” modes, since if they are kinematically allowed they can dominate, spoiling the trilepton signal. This is because if the <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> decay is through an on-shell <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Z^0\)</span>, then the final state will likely include jets (especially bottom-quark jets in the case of <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span>) rather than isolated leptons. Although the trilepton signal is lost, supersymmetric events with <span class="math inline">\(h^0 \rightarrow b \bar b\)</span> following from <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow h^0 {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> could eventually be useful at the LHC, especially since we now know that <span class="math inline">\(M_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV.</p>
<p>One should also be aware of interesting signals that can appear for particular ranges of parameters. Final state leptons appearing in the signals listed above might be predominantly tau, and so a significant fraction could be realized as hadronic <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> jets. This is because most models based on lepton universality at the input scale predict that <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> is lighter than the selectrons and smuons. Similarly, supersymmetric events may have a preference for bottom jets, sometimes through decays involving top quarks because <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}t_1\)</span> is relatively light, and sometimes because <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}b_1\)</span> is expected to be lighter than the squarks of the first two families, and sometimes for both reasons. In such cases, there will be at least four potentially <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-taggable jets in each event. Other things being equal, the larger <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> is, the stronger the preference for hadronic <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> jets will be in supersymmetric events.</p>
<p>After evidence for the existence of supersymmetry is acquired, the LHC data can be used to extract sparticle masses by analyzing the kinematics of the decays. With a neutralino LSP always escaping the detector, there are no true invariant mass peaks possible. However, various combinations of masses can be measured using kinematic edges and other reconstruction techniques. For a particularly favorable possibility, suppose the decay of the second-lightest neutralino occurs in two stages through a real slepton, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-{\widetilde}N_1\)</span>. Then the resulting dilepton invariant mass distribution is as shown in fig. [fig:LHCendpoint].</p>

<p>It features a sharp edge, allowing a precision measurement of the corresponding combination of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> masses <span class="citation" data-cites="LHCN2edge LHCdileptonedge ATLASTDR">@LHCN2edge [@LHCdileptonedge; @ATLASTDR]</span>, cuts will distort the shape, especially on the low end. There are significant backgrounds to this analysis, for example coming from <span class="math inline">\(t\overline t\)</span> production. However, the signal from <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2\)</span> has same-flavor leptons, while the background has contributions from different flavors. Therefore the edge can be enhanced by plotting the combination <span class="math inline">\([e^+e^-] + [\mu^+\mu^-] - [e^+\mu^-] - [\mu^+e^-]\)</span>, subtracting the background.</p>
<p>Heavier sparticle mass combinations can also be reconstructed at the LHC <span class="citation" data-cites="ATLASTDR">@ATLASTDR</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Kawagoe">@Kawagoe</span> using other kinematic distributions. For example, consider the gluino decay chain <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}g \rightarrow q {\widetilde}q^* \rightarrow q \bar q {\widetilde}N_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}\ell^* \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^- {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> as above. By selecting events close to the dilepton mass edge as determined in the previous paragraph, one can reconstruct a peak in the invariant mass of the <span class="math inline">\(jj\ell^+\ell^-\)</span> system, which correlates well with the gluino mass. As another example, the decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}q_L \rightarrow q {\widetilde}N_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_2 \rightarrow h^0 {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> can be analyzed by selecting events near the peak from <span class="math inline">\(h^0 \rightarrow b \overline b\)</span>. There will then be a broad <span class="math inline">\(jb\bar b\)</span> invariant mass distribution, with a maximum value that can be related to <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde N_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde N_1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde q_L}\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV is known. There are many other similar opportunities, depending on the specific sparticle spectrum. These techniques may determine the sparticle mass differences much more accurately than the individual masses, so that the mass of the unobserved LSP will be constrained but not precisely measured.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the 2012 discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, presumably <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span>, the remaining Higgs scalar bosons of the MSSM are also targets of searches at the the LHC. The heavier neutral Higgs scalars can be searched for in decays <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;

\\
&amp;&amp;
A^0 \&gt;\rightarrow\&gt; Z h^0 \&gt;\rightarrow\&gt; \ell^+ \ell^- b \overline b,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with prospects that vary considerably depending on the parameters of the model. The charged Higgs boson may also appear at the LHC in top-quark decays, if <span class="math inline">\(m_{H^+} &lt; m_t\)</span>. If instead <span class="math inline">\(m_{H^+} &gt; m_t\)</span>, then one can look for <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
bg \rightarrow t H^-
\qquad\mbox{or}\qquad
gg \rightarrow t \overline b H^-,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> followed by the decay <span class="math inline">\(H^- \rightarrow \tau^- \bar \nu_\tau\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H^- \rightarrow \bar t b\)</span> in each case, or the charge conjugates of these processes. More details on Higgs search projections and experimental results are available at the ATLAS and CMS physics results web pages.</p>
<p>The remainder of this subsection briefly considers the possibility that the LSP is the goldstino/gravitino, in which case the sparticle discovery signals discussed above can be significantly improved. If the NLSP is a neutralino with a prompt decay, then <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow \gamma{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> will yield events with two energetic, isolated photons plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> from the escaping gravitinos, rather than just <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span>. So at a hadron collider the signal is <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\gamma+X+{{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is any collection of leptons plus jets. The Standard Model backgrounds relevant for such events are quite small. If the <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> decay length is long enough, then it may be measurable because the photons will not point back to the event vertex. This would be particularly useful, as it would give an indication of the supersymmetry-breaking scale <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\langle F \rangle}\)</span>; see eq. ([generalgravdecay]) and the discussion in section [subsec:decays.gravitino]. If the <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> decay is outside of the detector, then one just has the usual leptons + jets + <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}_T}}\)</span> signals as discussed above in the neutralino LSP scenario.</p>
<p>In the case that the NLSP is a charged slepton, then the decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> can provide two extra leptons in each event, compared to the signals with a neutralino LSP. If the <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> is sufficiently lighter than the other charged sleptons <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span> and so is effectively the sole NLSP, then events will always have a pair of taus. If the slepton NLSP is long-lived, one can look for events with a pair of very heavy charged particle tracks or a long time-of-flight in the detector. Since slepton pair production usually has a much smaller cross-section than the other processes in ([eq:qqbarinos])-([eq:qqsquarks]), this will typically be accompanied by leptons and/or jets from the same event vertex, which may be of crucial help in identifying candidate events. It is also quite possible that the decay length of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> is measurable within the detector, seen as a macroscopic kink in the charged particle track. This would again be a way to measure the scale of supersymmetry breaking through eq. ([generalgravdecay]).</p>

<p>as shown in figs. [fig:eecharginoprod]-[fig:eesquarkprod]. The important interactions for sparticle production are the gaugino-fermion-scalar couplings shown in Figures [fig:gaugino]b,c and the ordinary vector boson interactions. The cross-sections are therefore determined just by the electroweak gauge couplings and the sparticle mixings. They were calculated in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="epprod">@epprod</span>, and are available in computer programs <span class="citation" data-cites="ISAJET">@ISAJET</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="PYTHIA">@PYTHIA</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Herwig">@Herwig</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="SUSYGEN">@SUSYGEN</span>.</p>
<p>All of the processes in eq. ([eesignals]) get contributions from the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel exchange of the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> boson and, for charged sparticle pairs, the photon. In the cases of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_i^+ {\widetilde}C_j^-\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_i {\widetilde}N_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R^+ {\widetilde}e_R^-\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L^+ {\widetilde}e_L^-\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_L^\pm {\widetilde}e_R^\mp\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_e {\widetilde}\nu_e^*\)</span> production, there are also <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel diagrams exchanging a virtual sneutrino, selectron, neutralino, neutralino, neutralino, and chargino, respectively. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel contributions are significant if the exchanged sparticle is not too heavy. For example, the production of wino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^+ {\widetilde}C_1^-\)</span> pairs typically suffers a destructive interference between the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel graphs with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma,Z\)</span> exchange and the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel graphs with <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_e\)</span> exchange, if the sneutrino is not too heavy. In the case of sleptons, the pair production of smuons and staus proceeds only through <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel diagrams, while selectron production also has a contribution from the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel exchanges of the neutralinos, as shown in Figure [fig:eesleptonprod]. For this reason, the selectron production cross-section may be significantly larger than that of smuons or staus at <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> colliders.</p>
<p>The pair-produced sparticles decay as discussed in section [sec:decays]. If the LSP is the lightest neutralino, it will always escape the detector because it has no strong or electromagnetic interactions. Every event will have two LSPs leaving the detector, so there should be at least <span class="math inline">\(2m_{{{\widetilde}N_1}}\)</span> of missing energy (<span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span>). For example, in the case of <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^+ {\widetilde}C_1^-\)</span> production, the possible signals include a pair of acollinear leptons and <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span>, or one lepton and a pair of jets plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span>, or multiple jets plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span>. The relative importance of these signals depends on the branching fraction of the chargino into the competing final states, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1 \rightarrow \ell\nu {{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(qq^\prime{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>. In the case of slepton pair production, the signal should be two energetic, acollinear, same-flavor leptons plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span>. There is a potentially large Standard Model background for the acollinear leptons plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span> and the lepton plus jets plus <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span> signals, coming from <span class="math inline">\(W^+W^-\)</span> production with one or both of the <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> bosons decaying leptonically. However, these and other Standard Model backgrounds can be kept under control with angular cuts, and beam polarization if available. It is not difficult to construct the other possible signatures for sparticle pairs, which can become quite complicated for the heavier charginos, neutralinos and squarks.</p>
<p>The MSSM neutral Higgs bosons can also be produced at <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> colliders, with the principal processes of interest at low energies <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^+e^- \rightarrow h^0 Z,
\qquad\qquad
e^+e^-\rightarrow h^0A^0,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> shown in fig. [fig:eehiggs]. At tree-level, the first of these has a cross-section given by the corresponding Standard Model cross-section multiplied by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\sin^2(\beta - \alpha)\)</span>, which approaches 1 in the decoupling limit of <span class="math inline">\(m_{A^0} \gg m_Z\)</span> discussed in section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]. The other process is complementary, since (up to kinematic factors) its cross-section is the same but multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(\cos^2(\beta - \alpha)\)</span>, which is significant if <span class="math inline">\(m_{A^0}\)</span> is not large. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s}\)</span> is high enough [note the mass relation eq. ([eq:m2Hpm])], one can also have <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^+e^-\rightarrow H^+ H^-,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with a cross-section that is fixed, at tree-level, in terms of <span class="math inline">\(m_{H^\pm}\)</span>, and also <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

Also, at sufficiently high <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s}\)</span>, the process <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^+ e^- \rightarrow \nu_e \bar \nu_e h^0 \end{eqnarray}\]</span> following from <span class="math inline">\(W^+W^-\)</span> fusion provides the best way to study the Higgs boson decays, which can differ <span class="citation" data-cites="GunionHaber HHG Haber:1997dt">@GunionHaber [@HHG; @Haber:1997dt]</span> from those in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>The CERN LEP <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider conducted searches until November 2000, with various center of mass energies up to 209 GeV, yielding no firm evidence for superpartner production. The resulting limits <span class="citation" data-cites="LEPSUSYWG">@LEPSUSYWG</span> on the charged sparticle masses are of order roughly half of the beam energy, minus taxes paid for detection and identification efficiencies, backgrounds, and the suppression of cross-sections near threshold. The bounds become weaker if the mass difference between the sparticle in question and the LSP (or another sparticle that the produced one decays into) is less than a few GeV, because then the available visible energy can be too small for efficient detection and identification. Despite the strong limits coming from the LHC, some of the limits from LEP are still relevant, especially when the mass differences between supersymmetric particle are small.</p>
<p>For example, LEP established limits <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde e_R} &gt; 99\)</span> GeV and <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde \mu_R} &gt; 95\)</span> GeV at 95% CL, provided that <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde \ell_R} - m_{\tilde N_1} &gt; 10\)</span> GeV, and that the branching fraction for <span class="math inline">\(\ell_R \rightarrow \ell {\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is 100% in each case. The limit for staus is weaker, and depends somewhat more strongly on the neutralino LSP mass. The LEP chargino mass bound is approximately <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde C_1} &gt; 103\)</span> GeV for mass differences <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde C_1} - m_{\tilde N_1} &gt; 3\)</span> GeV, assuming that the chargino decays predominantly through a virtual <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, or with similar branching fractions. However, this bound reduces to about <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde C_1} &gt; 92\)</span> GeV for <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> MeV <span class="math inline">\(&lt; m_{\tilde C_1} - m_{\tilde N_1} &lt; 3\)</span> GeV. For small positive mass differences 0 <span class="math inline">\(&lt; m_{\tilde C_1} - m_{\tilde N_1} &lt;\)</span> 100 MeV, the limit is again about <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde C_1} &gt; 103\)</span> GeV, because the chargino is long-lived enough to have a displaced decay vertex or leave a track as it moves through the detector. These limits assume that the sneutrino is heavier than about 200 GeV, so that it does not significantly reduce the production cross-section by interference of the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel diagrams in fig. [fig:eecharginoprod]. If the sneutrino is lighter, then the bound reduces, especially if <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde C_1} - m_{\tilde \nu}\)</span> is positive but small, so that the decay <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1 \rightarrow \tilde \nu \ell\)</span> dominates but releases very little visible energy. More details on these and many other legacy limits from the LEP runs can be found at <span class="citation" data-cites="LEPSUSYWG">@LEPSUSYWG</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="RPP">@RPP</span>.</p>
<p>If supersymmetry is the solution to the hierarchy problem, then the LHC may be able to establish strong evidence for it, and measure some of the sparticle mass differences, as discussed in the previous subsection. However, many important questions will remain. Competing theories can also produce missing energy signatures. The overall mass scale of sparticles may not be known as well as one might like. Sparticle production will be inclusive and overlapping and might be difficult to disentangle. A future <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider with sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s}\)</span> should be able to resolve these issues, and establish more firmly that supersymmetry is indeed responsible, to the exclusion of other candidate theories. In particular, the couplings, spins, gauge quantum numbers, and absolute masses of the sparticles will all be measurable.</p>
<p>At an <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider, the processes in eq. ([eesignals]) can all be probed close to their kinematic limits, given sufficient integrated luminosity. (In the case of sneutrino pair production, this assumes that some of the decays are visible, rather than just <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu\rightarrow\nu{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>.) Establishing the properties of the particles can be done by making use of polarized beams and the relatively clean <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider environment. For example, consider the production and decay of sleptons in <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^- \rightarrow {\widetilde}\ell^+{\widetilde}\ell^-\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell \rightarrow \ell{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>. The resulting leptons will have (up to significant but calculable effects of initial-state radiation, beamstrahlung, cuts, and detector efficiencies and resolutions) a flat energy distribution as shown in fig. [fig:ILCendpoints].</p>
<p>[]<span>0.6</span></p>
<p>[]<span>0.339</span></p>
<p>(165,80)(-30,0) (0,0)(100,0) (0,0)(0,50) (9,77)[]<span>Events/GeV</span> (138,-10)[]<span><span class="math inline">\(E_{\ell}\)</span></span> (93,-10)[]<span><span class="math inline">\(E_{\rm max}\)</span></span> (21,-10)[]<span><span class="math inline">\(E_{\rm min}\)</span></span> (0,0)(12,0) (12,0)(12,40) (12,40)(65,40) (65,40)(65,0) (65,0)(100,0)</p>
<p>By measuring the endpoints of this distribution, one can precisely and uniquely determine both <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\widetilde}\ell_R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>. There is a large <span class="math inline">\(W^+W^- \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^{\prime -} \nu_\ell \bar \nu_{\ell&#39;}\)</span> background, but this can be brought under control using angular cuts, since the positively (negatively) charged leptons from the background tend to go preferentially along the same direction as the positron (electron) beam. Also, since the background has uncorrelated lepton flavors, it can be subtracted. Changing the polarization of the electron beam will even further reduce the background, and will also allow controlled variation of the production of right-handed and left-handed sleptons, to get at the electroweak quantum numbers.</p>
<p>More generally, inclusive sparticle production at a given fixed <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collision energy will result in a superposition of various kinematic edges in lepton and jet energies, and distinctive distributions in dilepton and dijet energies and invariant masses. By varying the beam polarization and changing the beam energy, these observables give information about the couplings and masses of the sparticles. For example, in the ideal limit of a right-handed polarized electron beam, the reaction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
e^-_R e^+ \rightarrow {\widetilde}C_1^+ {\widetilde}C_1^-\end{eqnarray}\]</span> is suppressed if <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1\)</span> is pure wino, because in the first diagram of fig. [fig:eecharginoprod] the right-handed electron only couples to the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span> gauge boson linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma,Z\)</span> while the wino only couples to the orthogonal <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> gauge boson linear combination, and in the second diagram the electron-sneutrino-chargino coupling involves purely left-handed electrons. Therefore, the polarized beam cross-section can be used to determine the charged wino mixing with the charged higgsino. Even more precise information about the sparticle masses can be obtained by varying the beam energy in small discrete steps very close to thresholds, an option unavailable at hadron colliders. The rise of the production cross-section above threshold provides information about the spin and “handedness”, because the production cross-sections for <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \ell_R^+ \tilde \ell_R^-\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde \ell_L^+ \tilde \ell_L^-\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave and therefore rise like <span class="math inline">\(\beta^3\)</span> above threshold, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the velocity of one of the produced sparticles. In contrast, the rates for <span class="math inline">\(\tilde e_L^\pm \tilde e_R^\mp\)</span> and for chargino and neutralino pair production are <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave, and therefore should rise like <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> just above threshold. By measuring the angular distributions of the final state leptons and jets with respect to the beam axis, the spins of the sparticles can be inferred. These will provide crucial tests that the new physics that has been discovered is indeed supersymmetry.</p>
<p>A sample of the many detailed studies along these lines can be found in refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="ilcmassdetrefs">@ilcmassdetrefs</span><span class="citation" data-cites="ALC">@ALC</span>. In general, a future <span class="math inline">\(e^+ e^-\)</span> collider will provide an excellent way of testing softly-broken supersymmetry and measuring the model parameters, if it has enough energy. Furthermore, the processes <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^- \rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(h^0Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h^0A^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^0Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^0A^0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^+H^-\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(h^0 \nu_e \bar \nu_e\)</span> should be able to test the Higgs sector of supersymmetry at an <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\)</span> collider.</p>
<p>The situation may be qualitatively better if the gravitino is the LSP as in gauge-mediated models, because of the decays mentioned in section [subsec:decays.gravitino]. If the lightest neutralino is the NLSP and the decay <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow\gamma{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> occurs within the detector, then even the process <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\rightarrow {{\widetilde}N_1}{{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> leads to a dramatic signal of two energetic photons plus missing energy <span class="citation" data-cites="eeGMSBsignal">@eeGMSBsignal</span><span class="citation" data-cites="AKKMM2">@AKKMM2</span>. There are significant backgrounds to the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\gamma{{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span> signal, but they are easily removed by cuts. Each of the other sparticle pair-production modes eq. ([eesignals]) will lead to the same signals as in the neutralino LSP case, but now with two additional energetic photons, which should make the experimentalists’ tasks quite easy. If the decay length for <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow\gamma{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> is much larger than the size of a detector, then the signals revert back to those found in the neutralino LSP scenario. In an intermediate regime for the <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow\gamma{{\widetilde}G}\)</span> decay length, one may see events with one or both photons displaced from the event vertex by a macroscopic distance.</p>
<p>If the NLSP is a charged slepton <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\rightarrow {\widetilde}\ell^+{\widetilde}\ell^-\)</span> followed by prompt decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell\rightarrow \ell {{\widetilde}G}\)</span> will yield two energetic same-flavor leptons in every event, and with a different energy distribution than the acollinear leptons that would follow from either <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}C_1^+{\widetilde}C_1^-\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell^+{\widetilde}\ell^-\)</span> production in the neutralino LSP scenario. Pair production of non-NLSP sparticles will yield unmistakable signals, which are the same as those found in the neutralino NLSP case but with two additional energetic leptons (not necessarily of the same flavor). An even more striking possibility is that the NLSP is a slepton that decays very slowly <span class="citation" data-cites="DDRT">@DDRT</span>. If the slepton NLSP is so long-lived that it decays outside the detector, then slepton pair production will lead to events featuring a pair of charged particle tracks with high ionization rates that betray their very large mass. If the sleptons decay within the detector, then one can look for large-angle kinks in the charged particle tracks, or a macroscopic impact parameter. The pair production of any of the other heavy charged sparticles will also yield heavy charged particle tracks or decay kinks, plus leptons and/or jets, but no <span class="math inline">\({{{\setbox0=\hbox{\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(} \dimen0=\wd0 \setbox1=\hbox{/} \dimen1=\wd1 \ifdim\dimen0&gt;\dimen1 \rlap{\hbox to \dimen0{\hfil/\hfil}} E \else \rlap{\hbox to \dimen1{\hfil\)</span>E<span class="math inline">\(\hfil}} / \fi}}}\)</span> unless the decay chains happen to include neutrinos.

<h2 id="subsec:signals.darkmatter"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Dark matter and its detection</h2>
<p>Evidence from experimental cosmology has now solidified to the point that, with some plausible assumptions, the cold dark matter density is known to be <span class="citation" data-cites="cosmokramer RPP">@cosmokramer [@RPP]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2 \approx 0.120,

Here <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\rm DM}\)</span> is the average energy density in non-baryonic dark matter divided by the total critical density that would lead to a spatially flat homogeneous universe, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km sec<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> Mpc<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>, observed to be <span class="math inline">\(h^2 \approx 0.46\)</span> with an error of order 3%. This translates into a cold dark matter density <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{\rm DM} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \&gt; {\rm GeV}/{\rm cm}^3 ,
\label{eq:rhodm}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> averaged over very large distance scales.</p>
<p>One of the nice features of supersymmetry with exact <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity conservation is that a stable electrically neutral LSP might be this cold dark matter. There are three obvious candidates: the lightest sneutrino, the gravitino, and the lightest neutralino. The possibility of a sneutrino LSP making up the dark matter with a cosmologically interesting density has been largely ruled out by direct searches <span class="citation" data-cites="sneutrinonotLSP">@sneutrinonotLSP</span> (see however <span class="citation" data-cites="sneutrinoLSP">@sneutrinoLSP</span>). If the gravitino is the LSP, as in many gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models, then gravitinos from reheating after inflation <span class="citation" data-cites="gravitinoDMfromreheating">@gravitinoDMfromreheating</span> or from other sparticle decays <span class="citation" data-cites="gravitinoDMfromdecays">@gravitinoDMfromdecays</span> might be the dark matter, but they would be impossible to detect directly even if they have the right cosmological density today. They interact too weakly. The most attractive prospects for direct detection of supersymmetric dark matter, therefore, are based on the idea that the lightest neutralino <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> is the LSP <span class="citation" data-cites="neutralinodarkmatter darkmatterreviews">@neutralinodarkmatter [@darkmatterreviews]</span>.</p>
<p>In the early universe, sparticles existed in thermal equilibrium with the ordinary Standard Model particles. As the universe cooled and expanded, the heavier sparticles could no longer be produced, and they eventually annihilated or decayed into neutralino LSPs. Some of the LSPs pair-annihilated into final states not containing sparticles. If there are other sparticles that are only slightly heavier, then they existed in thermal equilibrium in comparable numbers to the LSP, and their co-annihilations are also important in determining the resulting dark matter density <span class="citation" data-cites="GriestSeckel Gondolo:1990dk">@GriestSeckel [@Gondolo:1990dk]</span>. Eventually, as the density decreased, the annihilation rate became small compared to the cosmological expansion, and the <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> experienced “freeze out”, with a density today determined by this small rate and the subsequent dilution due to the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>In order to get the observed dark matter density today, the thermal-averaged effective annihilation cross-section times the relative speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of the LSPs should be about <span class="citation" data-cites="darkmatterreviews">@darkmatterreviews</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \sigma v \rangle \&gt;\sim\&gt; 1\&gt;{\rm pb} \&gt;\sim\&gt;

More detailed and precise estimates can be obtained with publicly available computer programs <span class="citation" data-cites="DarkSUSY micrOMEGAs">@DarkSUSY [@micrOMEGAs]</span>, so that the predictions of specific candidate models of supersymmetry breaking can be compared to eq. ([eq:OmegaDM]).

<p>If <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> is mostly higgsino or mostly wino, then the the annihilation diagram fig. [fig:darkmatterannihilation]c and the co-annihilation mechanisms provided by fig. [fig:coannihilation] are typically much too efficient <span class="citation" data-cites="Mizuta:1992qp EdsjoGondolo DNRY">@Mizuta:1992qp [@EdsjoGondolo; @DNRY]</span> to allow the full required cold dark matter density, unless the LSP is very heavy, of order 1 TeV or more. This is often considered to be somewhat at odds with the idea that supersymmetry is the solution to the hierarchy problem; on the other hand, it is consistent with the lower bounds set on sparticle masses by the LHC. However, for lighter higgsino-like or wino-like LSPs, non-thermal mechanisms can be invoked to provide the right dark matter abundance <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBphenotwo winoDM">@AMSBphenotwo [@winoDM]</span>.</p>
<p>A recurring feature of many models of supersymmetry breaking is that the lightest neutralino is mostly bino. It turns out that in much of the parameter space not already ruled out by LEP with a bino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span>, the predicted relic density is too high, either because the LSP couplings are too small, or the sparticles are too heavy, or both, leading to an annihilation cross-section that is too low. To avoid this, there must be significant contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\langle \sigma v \rangle\)</span>. The possibilities can be classified qualitatively in terms of the diagrams that contribute most strongly to the annihilation.</p>
<p>First, if at least one sfermion is not too heavy, the diagram of fig. [fig:darkmatterannihilation]a is effective in reducing the dark matter density. In models with a bino-like <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span>, the most important such contribution usually comes from <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}e_R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\mu_R\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\tau_1\)</span> slepton exchange. The region of parameter space where this works out right is often referred to by the jargon “bulk region”, because it corresponded to the main allowed region with dark matter density less than the critical density, before <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2\)</span> was accurately known and before the highest energy LEP searches had happened. However, the diagram of fig. [fig:darkmatterannihilation]a is subject to a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave suppression, and so sleptons that are light enough to reduce the relic density sufficiently are, in many models, also light enough to be excluded by LEP or LHC searches, or have difficulties with other indirect constraints. In the MSUGRA framework described in section [subsec:origins.sugra], the viable bulk region takes <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span> less than about 100 GeV and 250 GeV respectively, depending on other parameters. Within MSUGRA, this part of parameter space has now been thoroughly excluded by the LHC. If the final state of neutralino pair annihilation is instead <span class="math inline">\(t \overline t\)</span>, then there is no <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave suppression. This typically requires a top squark that is less than about 150 GeV heavier than the LSP, which in turn has <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde N_1}\)</span> between about <span class="math inline">\(m_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_t + 100\)</span> GeV. This situation does not occur in the MSUGRA framework, but can be natural if the ratio of gluino and wino mass parameters, <span class="math inline">\(M_3/M_2\)</span>, is smaller than the unification prediction of eq. ([eq:TiaEla]) by a factor of a few <span class="citation" data-cites="Compressed">@Compressed</span>.</p>
<p>A second way of annihilating excess bino-like LSPs to the correct density is obtained if <span class="math inline">\(2 m_{\tilde N_1} \approx m_{A^0}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(m_{H^0}\)</span>, as shown in fig. [fig:darkmatterannihilation]b, so that the cross-section is near a resonance pole. An <span class="math inline">\(A^0\)</span> resonance annihilation will be <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave, and so more efficient than a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H^0\)</span> resonance. Therefore, the most commonly found realization involves annihilation through <span class="math inline">\(A^0\)</span>. Because the <span class="math inline">\(A^0 b \overline b\)</span> coupling is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_b \tan\beta\)</span>, this usually entails large values of <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="DNDM">@DNDM</span>. (Annihilation through <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> is also possible <span class="citation" data-cites="hfunnel">@hfunnel</span>, if the LSP mass is close to <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}/2 = 62.5\)</span> GeV.) The region of parameter space where this happens is often called the “<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>-funnel” or “Higgs funnel” or “Higgs resonance region”.</p>
<p>A third effective annihilation mechanism is obtained if <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> mixes to obtains a significant higgsino or wino admixture. Then both fig. [fig:darkmatterannihilation]c and the co-annihilation diagrams of fig. [fig:coannihilation] can be important <span class="citation" data-cites="EdsjoGondolo">@EdsjoGondolo</span>. In the “focus point” region of parameter space, where <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|\)</span> is not too large, an LSP with a significant higgsino content can yield the correct relic abundance even for very heavy squarks and sleptons <span class="citation" data-cites="focuspointDM">@focuspointDM</span>. This is motivated by focusing properties of the renormalization group equations, which allow <span class="math inline">\(|\mu|^2 \ll m_0^2\)</span> in MSUGRA models <span class="citation" data-cites="hyperbolic focuspoint">@hyperbolic [@focuspoint]</span>. In fact, within MSUGRA, squarks are required to be very heavy, typically several TeV. This possibility is attractive, given the LHC results that exclude most models with squarks lighter than 1 TeV. It is also possible to arrange for just enough wino content in the LSP to do the job <span class="citation" data-cites="winocontentDM">@winocontentDM</span>, by choosing <span class="math inline">\(M_1/M_2\)</span> appropriately.</p>
<p>A fourth possibility, the “sfermion co-annihilation region” of parameter space, is obtained if there is a sfermion that happens to be less than a few GeV heavier than the LSP <span class="citation" data-cites="GriestSeckel">@GriestSeckel</span>. In many model frameworks, this is most naturally the lightest stau <span class="citation" data-cites="staucoannihilation">@staucoannihilation</span>, but it could also be the lightest top squark <span class="citation" data-cites="stopcoannihilation">@stopcoannihilation</span>. A significant density of this sfermion will then coexist with the LSP around the freeze-out time, and so annihilations involving the sfermion with itself or with the LSP, including those of the type shown in fig. [fig:sfermioncoannihilation], will further dilute the number of sparticles and so the eventual dark matter density.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that a set of MSSM Lagrangian parameters that “fails” to predict the correct relic dark matter abundance by the standard thermal mechanisms is <span><em>not</em></span> ruled out as a model for collider physics. This is because simple extensions can completely change the dark matter relic abundance prediction without changing the predictions for colliders much or at all. For example, if the model predicts a neutralino dark matter abundance that is too small, one need only assume another sector (even a completely disconnected one) with a stable neutral particle, or that the dark matter is supplied by some non-thermal mechanism such as out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy particles. If the predicted neutralino dark matter abundance appears to be too large, one can assume that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is slightly broken, so that the offending LSP decays before nucleosynthesis; this would require some other unspecified dark matter candidate. Or, the dark matter LSP might be some particle that the lightest neutralino decays into. One possibility is a gravitino LSP <span class="citation" data-cites="gravitinoDMfromdecays">@gravitinoDMfromdecays</span>. Another example is obtained by extending the model to solve the strong CP problem with an invisible axion, which can allow the LSP to be a very weakly-interacting axino <span class="citation" data-cites="axinoDM">@axinoDM</span> (the fermionic supersymmetric partner of the axion). In such cases, the dark matter density after the lightest neutralino decays would be reduced compared to its naively predicted value by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm LSP}/m_{\tilde N_1}\)</span>, provided that other sources for the LSP relic density are absent. A correct density for neutralino LSPs can also be obtained by assuming that they are produced non-thermally in reheating of the universe after neutralino freeze-out but before nucleosynthesis <span class="citation" data-cites="gelgon">@gelgon</span>. Finally, in the absence of a compelling explanation for the apparent cosmological constant, it seems possible that the standard model of cosmology will still need to be modified in ways not yet imagined.</p>
<p>If neutralino LSPs really make up the cold dark matter, then their local mass density in our neighborhood ought to be of order 0.3 GeV/cm<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> [much larger than the density averaged over the largest scales, eq. ([eq:rhodm])] in order to explain the dynamics of our own galaxy. LSP neutralinos could be detectable directly through their weak interactions with ordinary matter, or indirectly by their ongoing annihilations. However, the dark matter halo is subject to significant uncertainties in density, velocity, and clumpiness, so even if the Lagrangian parameters were known exactly, the signal rates would be quite indefinite, possibly even by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>The direct detection of <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> depends on their elastic scattering off of heavy nuclei in a detector. At the parton level, <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span> can interact with a quark by virtual exchange of squarks in the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel, or Higgs scalars or a <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> boson in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel. It can also scatter off of gluons through one-loop diagrams. The scattering mediated by neutral Higgs scalars is suppressed by tiny Yukawa couplings, but is coherent for the quarks and so can actually be the dominant contribution for nuclei with larger atomic weights, if the squarks are heavy. The energy transferred to the nucleus in these elastic collisions is typically of order tens of keV per event. There are important backgrounds from natural radioactivity and cosmic rays, which can be reduced by shielding and pulse-shape analysis. A wide variety of current or future experiments are sensitive to some, but not all, of the parameter space of the MSSM that predicts a dark matter abundance in the range of eq. ([eq:OmegaDM]).</p>
<p>Another, more indirect, way to detect neutralino LSPs is through ongoing annihilations. This can occur in regions of space where the density is greatly enhanced. If the LSPs lose energy by repeated elastic scattering with ordinary matter, they can eventually become concentrated inside massive astronomical bodies like the Sun or the Earth. In that case, the annihilation of neutralino pairs into final states leading to neutrinos is the most important process, since no other particles can escape from the center of the object where the annihilation is going on. In particular, muon neutrinos and antineutrinos from <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}{{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow W^+ W^-\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(ZZ\)</span>, (or possibly <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}{{\widetilde}N_1}\rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nu\overline\nu\)</span>, although these are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave suppressed) will travel large distances, and can be detected in neutrino telescopes. The neutrinos undergo a charged-current weak interaction in the earth, water, or ice under or within the detector, leading to energetic upward-going muons pointing back to the center of the Sun or Earth.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that neutralino LSP annihilation in the galactic center (or the halo) could result in high-energy photons from cascade decays of the heavy Standard Model particles that are produced. These photons could be detected in air Cerenkov telescopes or in space-based detectors. There are also interesting possible signatures from neutralino LSP annihilation in the galactic halo producing detectable quantities of high-energy positrons or antiprotons.</p>
<p>More information on these possibilities, and the various experiments that can exploit them, can be found from refs. <span class="citation" data-cites="darkmatterreviews">@darkmatterreviews</span> and papers referred to in them.</p>
<h1 id="sec:variations"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Beyond minimal supersymmetry</h1>
<p>In this section I will briefly outline a few of my favorite variations on the basic picture of the MSSM discussed above. First, the possibility of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violation is considered in section [subsec:variations.RPV]. Another obvious way to extend the MSSM is to introduce new chiral supermultiplets, corresponding to scalars and fermions that are all sufficiently heavy to have avoided discovery so far. This requires that the new chiral supermultiplets must form a real representation of the Standard Model gauge group; they can then have a significant positive effect on the Higgs boson mass through loop corrections, as described in section [subsec:variations.vectorlike]. However, the simplest possibility for adding particles is to put them in just one gauge-singlet chiral supermultiplet; this can raise the Higgs boson mass at tree level, as discussed in section [subsec:variations.NMSSM]. The resulting model is also attractive because it can solve the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem that was described in sections [subsec:mssm.superpotential] and [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]. Two other solutions to the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem, based on including non-renormalizable superpotential terms or Kähler potential terms, are discussed in section [subsec:variations.munonrenorm]. The MSSM could also be extended by introducing new gauge interactions that are spontaneously broken at high energies. The possibilities here include GUT models like <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(SO(10)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_6\)</span>, which unify the Standard Model gauge interactions, with important implications for rare processes like proton decay and <span class="math inline">\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma\)</span>. Superstring models also usually enlarge the Standard Model gauge group at high energies. One or more Abelian subgroups could survive to the TeV scale, leading to a <span class="math inline">\(Z&#39;\)</span> massive vector boson. There is a vast literature on these possibilities, but I will concentrate instead on the implications of just adding a single <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> factor that is assumed to be spontaneously broken at energies beyond the reach of any foreseeable collider. As described in section [subsec:variations.Dterms], the broken gauge symmetry can still leave an imprint on the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian at low energies.</p>

<p>In the preceding, it has been assumed that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity (or equivalently matter parity) is an exact symmetry of the MSSM. This assumption precludes renormalizable proton decay and predicts that the LSP should be stable, but despite these virtues <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is not inevitable. Because of the threat of proton decay, one expects that if <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is violated, then in the renormalizable Lagrangian either B-violating or L-violating couplings are allowed, but not both, as explained in section [subsec:mssm.rparity]. There are also upper bounds on the individual <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violating couplings <span class="citation" data-cites="RPVreviews">@RPVreviews</span>.</p>
<p>One proposal is that matter parity can be replaced by an alternative discrete symmetry that still manages to forbid proton decay at the level of the renormalizable Lagrangian. The <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_3\)</span> possibilities have been cataloged in ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="baryontriality">@baryontriality</span>, where it was found that provided no new particles are added to the MSSM, that the discrete symmetry is family-independent, and that it can be defined at the level of the superpotential, there is only one other candidate besides matter parity. That other possibility is a <span class="math inline">\(Z_3\)</span> discrete symmetry <span class="citation" data-cites="baryontriality">@baryontriality</span>, which was originally called “baryon parity” but is more appropriately referred to as “baryon triality”. The baryon triality of any particle with baryon number B and weak hypercharge <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is defined to be <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
Z_3^{\rm B} = {\rm exp}\left ({2\pi i} [{\rm B}-2Y]/3 \right ).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This is always a cube root of unity, since B<span class="math inline">\(-2Y\)</span> is an integer for every MSSM particle. The symmetry principle to be enforced is that the product of the baryon trialities of the particles in any term in the Lagrangian (or superpotential) must be 1. This symmetry conserves baryon number at the renormalizable level while allowing lepton number violation; in other words, it allows the superpotential terms in eq. ([WLviol]) but forbids those in eq. ([WBviol]). In fact, baryon triality conservation has the remarkable property that it absolutely forbids proton decay <span class="citation" data-cites="noprotondecay">@noprotondecay</span>. The reason for this is simply that baryon triality requires that B can only be violated in multiples of 3 units (even in non-renormalizable interactions), while any kind of proton decay would have to violate B by 1 unit. So it is eminently falsifiable. Similarly, baryon triality conservation predicts that experimental searches for neutron-antineutron oscillations will be negative, since they would violate baryon number by 2 units. However, baryon triality conservation does allow the LSP to decay. If one adds some new chiral supermultiplets to the MSSM (corresponding to particles that are presumably very heavy), one can concoct a variety of new candidate discrete symmetries besides matter parity and baryon triality. Some of these will allow B violation in the superpotential, while forbidding the lepton number violating superpotential terms in eq. ([WLviol]).</p>
<p>Another idea is that matter parity is an exact symmetry of the underlying superpotential, but it is spontaneously broken by the VEV of a scalar with <span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span>. One possibility is that an MSSM sneutrino gets a VEV <span class="citation" data-cites="sneutvevRPV">@sneutvevRPV</span>, since sneutrinos are scalars carrying L=1. However, there are strong bounds <span class="citation" data-cites="nonsneutvevRPV">@nonsneutvevRPV</span> on <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span>-doublet sneutrino VEVs <span class="math inline">\(\langle {\widetilde}\nu \rangle \ll m_Z\)</span> coming from the requirement that the corresponding neutrinos do not have large masses. It is somewhat difficult to understand why such a small VEV should occur, since the scalar potential that produces it must include soft sneutrino squared-mass terms of order <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{\rm soft}\)</span>. One can get around this by instead introducing a new gauge-singlet chiral supermultiplet with L=<span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. The scalar component can get a large VEV, which can induce L-violating terms (and in general B-violating terms also) in the low-energy effective superpotential of the MSSM <span class="citation" data-cites="nonsneutvevRPV">@nonsneutvevRPV</span>.</p>
<p>In any case, if <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity is violated, then the collider searches for supersymmetry can be completely altered. The new couplings imply single-sparticle production mechanisms at colliders, besides the usual sparticle pair production processes. First, one can have <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel single sfermion production. At electron-positron colliders, the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> couplings in eq. ([WLviol]) give rise to <span class="math inline">\(e^+e^-\rightarrow {\widetilde}\nu\)</span>. At the LHC, single sneutrino or charged slepton production, <span class="math inline">\(q \bar q \rightarrow {\widetilde}\nu\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\ell\)</span> are mediated by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&#39;\)</span> couplings, and single squark production <span class="math inline">\(qq \rightarrow {\widetilde}{\bar q}\)</span> is mediated by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&#39;&#39;\)</span> couplings in eq. ([WBviol]).</p>
<p>Second, one can have <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel exchange of sfermions, providing for gaugino production in association with a standard model fermion. At electron-positron colliders, one has <span class="math inline">\(e^+ e^- \rightarrow {\widetilde}C_i \ell\)</span> mediated by <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\nu_e\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel, and <span class="math inline">\(e^+ e^- \rightarrow {\widetilde}N_i \nu\)</span> mediated by selectrons in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel, if the appropriate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> couplings are present. At the LHC, one can look for the partonic processes <span class="math inline">\(q\overline q \rightarrow ({\widetilde}N_i\&gt;{\rm or}\&gt;{\widetilde}C_i\&gt;{\rm or}\&gt;\tilde g)+(\ell\&gt;{\rm or}\&gt;\nu)\)</span>, mediated by <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel squark exchange if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&#39;\)</span> couplings are present. If instead <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&#39;&#39;\)</span> couplings are present, then <span class="math inline">\(qq \rightarrow ({\widetilde}N_i\&gt;{\rm or}\&gt;{\widetilde}C_i\&gt;{\rm or}\&gt;\tilde g)+ q\)</span>, again with squarks exchanged in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel, provides a possible production mechanism.</p>
<p>Next consider sparticle decays. In many cases, the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violating couplings are already constrained by experiment, or expected from more particular theoretical models, to be smaller than electroweak gauge couplings <span class="citation" data-cites="RPVreviews">@RPVreviews</span>. If so, then the heavier sparticles will usually decay to final states containing the LSP, as in section [sec:decays]. However, now the LSP can also decay; if it is a neutralino, as most often assumed, then it will decay into three Standard Model fermions. The collider signals to be found depend on the type of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violation.</p>
<p>Lepton number violating terms of the type <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> as in eq. ([WLviol]) will lead to final states from <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> decay with two oppositely charged, and possibly different flavor, leptons and a neutrino, as in Figure [fig:rparityviolation]a,b.</p>

<p>Couplings of the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&#39;\)</span> type will cause <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1\)</span> to decay to a pair of jets and either a charged lepton or a neutrino, as shown in Figure [fig:rparityviolation]c,d,e.

<p>On the other hand, if terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\prime\prime}\)</span> in eq. ([WBviol]) are present instead, then there are B-violating decays <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}N_1 \rightarrow q q^\prime q^{\prime\prime}\)</span> from diagrams like the one shown in Figure [fig:rparityviolation]f. In that case, supersymmetric events will always have lots of hadronic activity, and will only have physics missing energy signatures when the other parts of the decay chains happen to include neutrinos.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities, too. The decaying LSP need not be <span class="math inline">\({{\widetilde}N_1}\)</span>. Sparticles that are not the LSP can, in principle, decay directly to Standard Models quarks and leptons, if the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violating couplings are large enough. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-channel exchange of sfermions can produce a pair of Standard Model fermions, leading to indirect sparticle signatures. Or, if the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violating couplings are sufficiently small, then the LSP will usually decay outside of collider detectors, and the model will be difficult or impossible to distinguish from the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity conserving case. Surveys of experimental constraints and future prospects can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="RPVreviews">@RPVreviews</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:variations.vectorlike"><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Extra vectorlike chiral supermultiplets</h2>
<p>An interesting way to extend the MSSM is by adding extra particles in chiral supermultiplets. It has now become clear that together the new fields must form a vectorlike (self-conjugate) representation of the Standard Model gauge group. Otherwise, the only way the new fermions could have masses large enough to have avoided discovery would be through extremely large Yukawa couplings to the Higgs VEVs. These couplings would in turn lead to very large corrections to the 125 GeV Higgs boson production cross-section at the LHC through loop effects, as well as corrections to electroweak precision observables, both in contradiction with the observations. In contrast, the addition of chiral supermultiplets with vectorlike quantum numbers to the MSSM does not lead to such problems, and can help to raise the lightest Higgs boson mass up to 125 GeV in models where it would otherwise be too light <span class="citation" data-cites="Moroi:1991mg">@Moroi:1991mg</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Graham:2009gy">@Graham:2009gy</span>.</p>
<p>If the new vectorlike chiral supermultiplets live in the fundamental representation of <span class="math inline">\(SU(2)_L\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_c\)</span>, or are charged under <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_Y\)</span>, then they must come in pairs with opposite gauge quantum numbers. If we call such a pair <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline \Phi_i\)</span>, then there is an allowed superpotential mass term of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W = M_i \Phi_i \overline \Phi_i ,
\label{eq:Wvectorlikemass}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> which does not involve any interactions with the Higgs boson. Note that such electroweak singlet mass terms can arise from whatever mechanism also gives rise to the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term of the MSSM. Three such possible mechanisms are described below in sections [subsec:variations.NMSSM] and [subsec:variations.munonrenorm]. Whatever that mechanism is, it is reasonable to suppose that it operates the same way to produce the masses <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> with the same order of magnitude as <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, i.e. at the TeV scale.</p>
<p>Because the new vectorlike particle have mostly electroweak singlet masses, they do not impact Higgs boson production and decay, and decouple from precision electroweak observables involving the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> self-energies and the Standard Model fermions. In order for the lightest of the new particles to not cause problems as stable relics from thermal production in the early universe, one may suppose that either <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\overline \Phi_i\)</span> has the same gauge quantum numbers as one of the MSSM quark and lepton chiral superfields, allowing small mixing Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. This small mixing allows the new vectorlike fermions to decay to Standard Model fermions.</p>
<p>If they are indeed at the TeV scale, the new particles can be pair-produced at the LHC, either through gluon fusion or through <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-channel <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> boson diagrams. Thus one can look for heavy cousins of the top quark, bottom quark, and/or tau lepton; call them <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b&#39;\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau&#39;\)</span>. These fermions will have decays that depend on the choice of mixing terms between them and the Standard Model fermions. The easiest way to minimize possible flavor problems in low-energy experiments is to assume that the mixing is primarily with the third family. Then the relevant decays will be: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
&amp;&amp;t&#39; \rightarrow Zt,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;h^0 t,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; W^+b,
\\
&amp;&amp;b&#39; \rightarrow Zb,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;h^0 b,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; W^-t,
\\
&amp;&amp;\tau&#39; \rightarrow Z\tau,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;h^0 \tau,\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; W^-\nu,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> with branching ratios that depend on the type of mixing Yukawa coupling. The possibilities and the resulting branching ratio predictions are discussed in detail in <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2009bg">@Martin:2009bg</span>. If the Yukawa couplings that mix the new fermions to the Standard Model fermions are larger than about <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span>, these 2-body decays will occur promptly within collider detectors. The scalar partners of these fermionic states are likely to be much heavier, because they have soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to their masses. In addition, for a given mass, production cross-sections for scalars tend to be lower than for fermions, so it is most likely that the new vectorlike fermions will be discovered first.</p>
<p>In order to raise the Higgs boson mass, one can also introduce a Yukawa coupling between the new chiral supermultiplets and the MSSM Higgs fields. As an example, suppose there are extra vectorlike chiral supermultiplets in the following representations of <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal Q} &amp;=&amp; ({\bf 3}, {\bf 2}, +1/6),\qquad\quad
\overline{\cal Q} \&gt;=\&gt; ({\bf \overline{3}}, {\bf 2}, -1/6),
\\
{\cal U} &amp;=&amp; ({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, +2/3),\qquad\quad
\overline{\cal U} \&gt;=\&gt; ({\bf \overline{3}}, {\bf 1}, -2/3).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Then the allowed superpotential terms include: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W &amp;=&amp; M_{\cal Q} {\cal Q}\overline{\cal Q} + 
M_{\cal U} {\cal U}\overline{\cal U}
+ k H_u {\cal Q}\overline{\cal U}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M_{\cal Q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{\cal U}\)</span> are electroweak singlet masses as in eq. ([eq:Wvectorlikemass]), and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a Yukawa coupling, which can be large and yet provide only a subdominant contribution to the masses of the vectorlike states. There is an infrared-stable quasi-fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(k\approx 1.05\)</span>, giving a natural expectation for its magnitude <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2009bg">@Martin:2009bg</span>. This coupling mediates a positive 1-loop contribution to lightest Higgs scalar boson mass, provided that the masses of the new scalars are larger than the masses of the new fermions. (This is similar to the 1-loop contribution from the top/stop sector.) An approximate formula for this contribution, with several simplifying assumptions, is <span class="citation" data-cites="Babu:2008ge">@Babu:2008ge</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta (m_{h^0}^2) = \frac{3}{4 \pi^2} k^4 v^2 \sin^4\beta \left [
\ln(x) - \frac{1}{6} (5-1/x)(1-1/x) \right ]
\label{eq:deltamhvectorlike}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(x = M_S^2/M_F^2\)</span>, and it is assumed that the scalars in <span class="math inline">\({\cal Q}, \overline{\cal Q}, {\cal U}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\cal U}\)</span> are approximately degenerate with each other with average mass <span class="math inline">\(M_S\)</span>, and likewise for the new fermions with average mass $M_F M_{Q} M_{U} $, that <span class="math inline">\(k v_u\)</span> is a small perturbation on these masses, and that the mixing in the new scalar sector is small. It is also assumed that the Higgs bosons are in the decoupling limit described at the end of section [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs]. For <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span>, eq. ([eq:deltamhvectorlike]) is positive definite and monotonically increasing with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. For example, with <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>, the correction to the Higgs boson mass can be about 10 GeV. (Results for the Higgs mass correction with these assumptions relaxed can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2009bg">@Martin:2009bg</span>; mixing in the scalar sector increases the Higgs mass correction.) Note that even in the limit of very large <span class="math inline">\(M_F\)</span>, the contribution to <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}^2\)</span> does not decouple, provided only that the hierarchy <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span> is maintained. Despite this non-decoupling contribution to <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}^2\)</span>, the contributions to precision electroweak observables do decouple quadratically (like <span class="math inline">\(m_W^2/M_F^2\)</span>), and so are quite benign <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2009bg">@Martin:2009bg</span>.</p>
<p>The positive contribution to the Higgs mass from extra vectorlike quarks is a plausible way to rescue supersymmetric theories that would otherwise have difficulty in accommodating the 125 GeV Higgs boson. For example, GMSB models typically predict much lower <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0}\)</span>, unless all of the superpartners are well out of reach of the LHC, because they imply small top-squark mixing. However, including extra vectorlike quarks with a large Yukawa coupling allows the MSSM superpartners to be as light as their direct experimental limits in GMSB models, while still allowing <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV <span class="citation" data-cites="Endo:2011mc">@Endo:2011mc</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Martin:2012dg">@Martin:2012dg</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:variations.NMSSM"><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> The next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model</h2>
<p>The simplest possible extension of the particle content of the MSSM is obtained by adding a new gauge-singlet chiral supermultiplet that is even under matter parity. The resulting model <span class="citation" data-cites="NMSSM">@NMSSM</span><span class="citation" data-cites="nMSSM">@nMSSM</span> is often called the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model or NMSSM or (M+1)SSM.

<p>One of the virtues of the NMSSM is that it can provide a solution to the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem mentioned in sections [subsec:mssm.superpotential] and [subsec:MSSMspectrum.Higgs].

By doing phase rotations on these fields, all three of <span class="math inline">\(s \equiv \langle S \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_u = v \sin\beta = \langle H_u^0 \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_d = v \cos\beta = \langle H_d^0 \rangle\)</span> can be made real and positive. In this convention, <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda + \lambda \kappa^* s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{\kappa} + 3 \lambda^* \kappa v_u v_d/s\)</span> will also be real and positive.</p>
<p>However, in general, this theory could have unacceptably large CP violation. This can be avoided by assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\kappa\)</span> are all real in the same convention that makes <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_u\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v_d\)</span> real and positive; this is natural if the mediation mechanism for supersymmetry breaking does not introduce new CP violating phases, and is assumed in the following. To have a stable minimum with respect to variations in the scalar field phases, it is required that <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda + \lambda \kappa s &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\kappa (a_\lambda + \lambda \kappa s) + 3 \lambda \kappa a_\lambda v_u v_d/s &gt; 0\)</span>. (An obvious sufficient, but not necessary, way to achieve these two conditions is to assume that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \kappa &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\kappa&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda &gt; 0\)</span>.)</p>
<p>An effective <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>-term for <span class="math inline">\(H_u H_d\)</span> will arise from eq. ([NMSSMwww]), with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
 \mu_{\rm eff} \&gt;=\&gt; \lambda s. \end{eqnarray}\]</span> It is determined by the dimensionless couplings and the soft terms of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>, instead of being a free parameter conceptually independent of supersymmetry breaking. With the conventions chosen here, the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\rm eff}\)</span> (or more generally its phase) is the same as that of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Instead of eqs. ([mubsub2]), ([mubsub1]), the minimization conditions for the Higgs potential are now: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
m^2_{H_u} + \lambda^2 (s^2 + v^2 \cos^2\beta) 
- (a_\lambda + \lambda \kappa s) s \cot\beta

\\
m^2_{S} + \lambda^2 v^2 + 2 \kappa^2 s^2 - a_\kappa s
-(\kappa\lambda  + a_\lambda/2 s) v^2 \sin(2\beta) &amp;=&amp; 0.\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The effects of radiative corrections <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V(v_u,v_d,s)\)</span> to the effective potential are included by replacing <span class="math inline">\(m_S^2 \rightarrow m_S^2 + [\partial (\Delta V)/\partial s]/2s\)</span>, in addition to eq. ([eq:Vradcor]).</p>
<p>The absence of dimensionful terms in <span class="math inline">\(W_{\rm NMSSM}\)</span>, and the corresponding terms in <span class="math inline">\(V_{\rm soft}^{\rm NMSSM}\)</span>, can be enforced by introducing a new symmetry. The simplest way is to notice that the new superpotential and Lagrangian will be invariant under a <span class="math inline">\(Z_3\)</span> discrete symmetry, under which every field in a chiral supermultiplet transforms as <span class="math inline">\(\Phi \rightarrow e^{2 \pi i/3} \Phi\)</span>, and all gauge and gaugino fields are inert. Imposing this symmetry indeed eliminates <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_S\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. However, if this symmetry were exact, then because it must be spontaneously broken by the VEVs of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_d\)</span>, domain walls are expected to be produced in the electroweak symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe <span class="citation" data-cites="NMSSMdomainwalls">@NMSSMdomainwalls</span>. These would dominate the cosmological energy density, and would cause unobserved anisotropies in the microwave background radiation. Several ways of avoiding this problem have been proposed, including late inflation after the domain walls are formed, embedding the discrete symmetry into a continuous gauged symmetry at very high energies, or allowing either higher-dimensional terms in the Lagrangian or a very small <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term to explicitly break the discrete symmetry.</p>
<p>The NMSSM contains, besides the particles of the MSSM, a real <span class="math inline">\(P_R=+1\)</span> scalar, a real <span class="math inline">\(P_R=+1\)</span> pseudo-scalar, and a <span class="math inline">\(P_R=-1\)</span> Weyl fermion “singlino”. These fields have no gauge couplings of their own, so they can only interact with Standard Model particles by mixing with the neutral MSSM fields with the same spin and charge. The real scalar mixes with the MSSM particles <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H^0\)</span>, and the pseudo-scalar mixes with <span class="math inline">\(A^0\)</span>. One of the effects of replacing the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term by the dynamical field <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is that the lightest Higgs boson squared mass is raised, by an amount bounded at tree-level by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta(m_{h^0}^2) &amp;\leq&amp; \lambda^2 v^2 \sin^2 (2 \beta).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This extra contribution comes from the <span class="math inline">\(|F_S|^2\)</span> contribution to the scalar potential. Its effect is limited, because there is an upper bound <span class="math inline">\(\lambda {\mathrel{{\;{{\setbox0=\hbox{\raise.35ex\hbox{\)</span>&lt;<span class="math inline">\(}}\setbox1=\hbox{\lower.65ex\hbox{\)</span><span class="math inline">\(}}\ifdim \wd1&gt;\wd0\kern.5\wd1\kern-.5\wd0\fi \copy0\kern-.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\copy1\ifdim\wd0&gt;\wd1 \kern.5\wd0\kern-.5\wd1\fi}}\;}}}0.8\)</span> if one requires that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> not have a Landau pole in its RG running below the GUT mass scale. Also, the neutral Higgs scalars have reduced couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons, compared to those in the Standard Model, because of the mixing with the singlets. Because the 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered by the LHC appears to have properties like those of a Standard Model Higgs boson, it seems unlikely to have a large admixture of the single field <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This means that there could be a yet-undiscovered neutral Higgs scalar that is mostly electroweak singlet and even lighter than 125 GeV.</p>
<p>The odd <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity singlino <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}S\)</span> mixes with the four MSSM neutralinos, so there are really five neutralinos now. The singlino could be the LSP, depending on the parameters of the model, and so could be the dark matter <span class="citation" data-cites="NMSSMdarkmatter">@NMSSMdarkmatter</span>. The neutralino mass matrix in the <span class="math inline">\(\psi^0 = ({\widetilde}B, {\widetilde}W^0, {\widetilde}H_d^0, {\widetilde}H_u^0, {\widetilde}S)\)</span> gauge-eigenstate basis is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf M}_{{\widetilde}N} \,=\, \pmatrix{
  M_1 &amp; 0 &amp; -g&#39; v_d/\sqrt{2} &amp; g&#39; v_u/\sqrt{2} &amp; 0\cr

  -g&#39; v_d/\sqrt{2} &amp; g v_d/\sqrt{2} &amp; 0 &amp; -\lambda s &amp; -\lambda v_u\cr

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\lambda v_u &amp; -\lambda v_d &amp; 2 \kappa s}.
\label{NMSSMNinomassmatrix}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> [Compare eq. ([preneutralinomassmatrix]).] For small <span class="math inline">\(v/s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda v/\kappa s\)</span>, mixing effects of the singlet Higgs scalar and the singlino are small, and they nearly decouple. In that case, the phenomenology of the NMSSM is almost indistinguishable from that of the MSSM. For larger <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the mixing is important and the experimental signals for sparticles and the Higgs scalars can be altered in important ways <span class="citation" data-cites="NMSSMpheno">@NMSSMpheno</span><span class="citation" data-cites="nMSSM">@nMSSM</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="NMHDECAY">@NMHDECAY</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:variations.munonrenorm"><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>-term from non-renormalizable Lagrangian terms</h2>
<p>The previous subsection described how the NMSSM can provide a solution to the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem. Another possible solution involves generating <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> from non-renormalizable Lagrangian terms. If the non-renormalizable terms are in the superpotential, this is called the Kim-Nilles mechanism@KimNilles, and if they are in the Kähler potential it is called the Giudice-Masiero mechanism@GiudiceMasiero.</p>
<p>It is useful to note that when the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term is set to zero, the MSSM superpotential has a global <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> Peccei-Quinn symmetry, with charges listed in Table [table:PecceiQuinn]. This symmetry cannot be an exact symmetry of the Lagrangian, since it has an <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_c\)</span> anomaly. However, if all other sources of Peccei-Quinn breaking are small, then there must result a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, the axion. If the scale of the breaking is too low, then the axion would be ruled out by astrophysical observations, so one must introduce an additional explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This is what happens in the NMSSM of the previous section. On the other hand, if the scale of Peccei-Quinn breaking is such that the axion decay constant is in the range <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}

This is an enticing possibility, since it links the solution to the strong CP problem to supersymmetry breaking.</p>

<p>To illustrate the Kim-Nilles mechanism, consider the non-renormalizable superpotential <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W = \frac{\lambda_\mu}{2{M_{\rm P}}} S^2 H_u H_d,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span> singlet chiral superfield, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_\mu\)</span> is a dimensionless coupling normalized by the reduced Planck mass <span class="math inline">\({M_{\rm P}}\)</span>. From Table [table:PecceiQuinn], <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has Peccei-Quinn charge <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> obtains a VEV that is parametrically of order <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle S \rangle \sim
\sqrt{m_{\rm soft} M_P},
\label{eq:KimNillesSVEV}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> then the spontaneous breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry gives rise to an invisible axion of the DFSZ type <span class="citation" data-cites="DFSZ">@DFSZ</span>, with a decay constant <span class="math inline">\(f \sim \langle S \rangle\)</span> that will automatically be in the range eq. ([eq:axionfrange]). The low-energy effective theory will then contain the usual <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term, with <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mu = \frac{\lambda_\mu}{2 M_P} \langle S^2 \rangle  \sim m_{\rm soft},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> simultaneously solving the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> problem and the strong CP problem. It is natural to also have a dimensionless, holomorphic soft supersymmetry-breaking term in the Lagrangian of the form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
-{\cal L}_{\rm soft} = \frac{a_b}{M_P} S^2 H_u H_d + {\rm c.c.},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_b\)</span> is of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> term in the MSSM will then arise as <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
b = \frac{a_b}{M_P} \langle S^2
\rangle,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> and will be of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}^2\)</span>, as required for electroweak symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>To ensure the required spontaneous breaking with a stable vacuum, one can introduce an additional non-renormalizable superpotential term, in several different possible ways <span class="citation" data-cites="MurayamaSuzukiYanagida">@MurayamaSuzukiYanagida</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Martinaxinos">@Martinaxinos</span>. For example, one could take <span class="citation" data-cites="Martinaxinos">@Martinaxinos</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W = \frac{\lambda_S}{4 M_{P}} S^2 S^{\prime 2},\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> is a chiral superfield with Peccei-Quinn charge <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>. This implies a scalar potential that stabilizes <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> at large field strength: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_S \,=\, |F_S|^2 + |F_{S&#39;}|^2 \,=\, \frac{|\lambda_S|^2}{4 M_P^2}
|S S&#39;|^2 (|S|^2 + |S&#39;|^2) .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> There is also a soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
-{\cal L}_{\rm soft} = V_{\rm soft} = m^2_S |S|^2  + m^2_{S&#39;}
|S&#39;|^2 - \left ( \frac{a_S}{4 M_P} S^2 S^{\prime 2}  + {\rm c.c.} \right ),\end{eqnarray}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m^2_S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{S&#39;}\)</span> are of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_S\)</span> is of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>. The total scalar potential <span class="math inline">\(V_S + V_{\rm soft}\)</span> will have an appropriate VEV of order eq. ([eq:KimNillesSVEV]) provided that <span class="math inline">\(m^2_S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m^2_{S&#39;}\)</span> are negative or if <span class="math inline">\(a_S\)</span> is sufficiently large. For example, with <span class="math inline">\(m^2_S = m^2_{S&#39;}\)</span> for simplicity, there will be a non-trivial minimum of the potential if <span class="math inline">\(|a_S|^2 - 12 m_S^2 |\lambda_S|^2 &gt; 0\)</span>, and it will be a global minimum of the potential if <span class="math inline">\(|a_S|^2 - 16 m_S^2 |\lambda_S|^2 &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>One pseudo-scalar degree of freedom, a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, is the axion, with a very small mass. The rest of the chiral supermultiplet from which the axion came will have masses of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>, but couplings to the MSSM that are highly suppressed. However, if one of the fermionic members of this chiral supermultiplet (a singlino that can be properly called an “axino” <span class="math inline">\(\tilde a\)</span>, and which has tiny mixing with the MSSM neutralinos <span class="math inline">\(\tilde N_i\)</span>) is lighter than all of the MSSM odd <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity particles, then it could be the LSP dark matter. If its relic density arises predominantly from decays of the would-be LSP <span class="math inline">\(\tilde N_1\)</span>, then today <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2\)</span> today can be obtained from that one would have obtained for <span class="math inline">\(\tilde N_1\)</span> if it were stable, but just suppressed by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde a}/m_{\tilde N_1}\)</span>. It is also possible that the decay of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde N_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\tilde a\)</span> could occur within a collider detector, rarely and with a macroscopic decay length but just often enough to provide a signal in a sufficiently large sample of superpartner pair production events <span class="citation" data-cites="Martinaxinos">@Martinaxinos</span>.</p>
<p>There are several variations on the theme given above. The non-renormalizable superpotential could instead have the schematic form <span class="math inline">\(S^3 S&#39; + S S&#39; H_u H_d\)</span> as in the original explicit model of this type <span class="citation" data-cites="MurayamaSuzukiYanagida">@MurayamaSuzukiYanagida</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(S^3 S&#39; + S^2 H_u H_d\)</span> as in <span class="citation" data-cites="ChoiChunKim">@ChoiChunKim</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(S S^{\prime 3} + S^2 H_u H_d\)</span> as in <span class="citation" data-cites="Martinaxinos">@Martinaxinos</span>, each entailing a different assignment of Peccei-Quinn charges for the gauge singlet fields, but with qualitatively similar behavior. One can also introduce more than two new fields that break the Peccei-Quinn symmetry at the intermediate scale.</p>
<p>The Giudice-Masiero mechanism instead relies on a non-renormalizable contribution to the Kähler potential in addition to the usual canonical terms for the MSSM Higgs fields: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
K = H_u H_u^* + H_d H_d^* + \Bigl (\frac{\lambda_\mu}{M_P} H_u H_d X^* +
{\rm c.c.} \Bigr ) + \ldots. \label{eq:KahlerpotentialforGiudiceMasiero}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_\mu\)</span> is a dimensionless coupling parameter and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has Peccei-Quinn charge <span class="math inline">\(+2\)</span>, and is a chiral superfield responsible for spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry through its auxiliary <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> field. Giudice and Masiero showed <span class="citation" data-cites="GiudiceMasiero">@GiudiceMasiero</span> that in supergravity, the presence of such couplings in the Kähler potential will always give rise to a non-zero <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> with a natural order-of-magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> term arises similarly with order-of-magnitude <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}^2\)</span>. The actual values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> depend on contributions to the full superpotential and Kähler potential involving the hidden-sector fields including <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>; see <span class="citation" data-cites="GiudiceMasiero">@GiudiceMasiero</span> for details. These terms do not have any other direct effect on phenomenology, so without faith in a complete underlying theory it will be difficult to correlate them with future experimental results.</p>
<p>One way of understanding the origin of the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> term in the Giudice-Masiero class of models is to consider the low-energy effective theory below <span class="math inline">\(M_P\)</span> involving a non-renormalizable Kähler potential term of the form in eq. ([eq:KahlerpotentialforGiudiceMasiero]). Even if not present in the fundamental theory, this term could arise from radiative corrections <span class="citation" data-cites="HallLykkenWeinberg">@HallLykkenWeinberg</span>. If the auxiliary field for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> obtains a VEV, then one obtains <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mu = \frac{\lambda_\mu}{M_P} \langle F_X^* \rangle .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> This will be of the correct order of magnitude if parametrically <span class="math inline">\(\langle F_X^* \rangle \sim m_{\rm soft} M_P\)</span>, which is indeed the typical size assigned to the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-terms of the hidden sector in Planck-scale mediated models of supersymmetry breaking. The <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> term in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector at low energies could arise in this effective field theory picture from Kähler potential terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(K = \frac{\lambda_b}{M_P^2} Y^* Z H_u H_d\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\langle F_Y^* \rangle \sim \langle F_Z \rangle \sim m_{\rm soft} M_P\)</span>. However, this is not necessary, because with <span class="math inline">\(\mu \not= 0\)</span>, the low-energy non-zero value of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> will arise from threshold effects and renormalization group running. One could also identify both of the fields <span class="math inline">\(Y,Z\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, at the cost of explicitly violating the Peccei-Quinn symmetry.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:variations.Dterms"><span class="header-section-number">11.5</span> Extra <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions to scalar masses</h2>
<p>Another way to generalize the MSSM is to include additional gauge interactions. The simplest possible gauge extension introduces just one new Abelian gauge symmetry; call it <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span>. If it is broken at a very high mass scale, then the corresponding vector gauge boson and gaugino fermion will both be heavy and will decouple from physics at the TeV scale and below. However, as long as the MSSM fields carry <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> charges, the breaking of <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> at an arbitrarily high energy scale can still leave a telltale imprint on the soft terms of the MSSM <span class="citation" data-cites="Dterms">@Dterms</span>.</p>
<p>To see how this works, let us consider the scalar potential for a model in which <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> is broken. Suppose that the MSSM scalar fields, denoted generically by <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>, carry <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. We also introduce a pair of chiral supermultiplets <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> charges normalized to <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> respectively. These fields are singlets under the Standard Model gauge group <span class="math inline">\(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\)</span>, so that when they get VEVs, they will just accomplish the breaking of <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span>. An obvious guess for the superpotential containing <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(W = M {S_+}{S_-}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a supersymmetric mass. However, unless <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> vanishes or is very small, it will yield positive-semidefinite quadratic terms in the scalar potential of the form <span class="math inline">\(V = |M|^2 (|{S_+}|^2 + |{S_-}|^2)\)</span>, which will force the minimum to be at <span class="math inline">\({S_+}= {S_-}= 0\)</span>. Since we want <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> to obtain VEVs, this is unacceptable. Therefore we assume that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is 0 (or very small) and that the leading contribution to the superpotential comes instead from a non-renormalizable term, say: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
W \,=\, {\lambda\over 2 {M_{\rm P}}} {S_+}^2 {S_-}^2.
\label{wfordterms}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The equations of motion for the auxiliary fields are then <span class="math inline">\(F^*_{{S_+}} = -\partial W/\partial {S_+}= -(\lambda/{M_{\rm P}}){S_+}{S_-}^{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^*_{{S_-}} = -\partial W/\partial {S_-}= -(\lambda/{M_{\rm P}}){S_-}{S_+}^{2}\)</span>, and the corresponding contribution to the scalar potential is <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_F \&gt;=\&gt; |F_{{S_+}}|^2 + |F_{{S_-}}|^2  \&gt;=\&gt;
{|\lambda|^2\over {M_{\rm P}}^2}
\Bigl ( |{S_+}|^4 |{S_-}|^2 + |{S_+}|^2 |{S_-}|^4 \Bigr )  .\end{eqnarray}\]</span> In addition, there are supersymmetry-breaking terms that must be taken into account: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V_{\rm soft} \,=\, m_+^2 |{S_+}|^2 + m_-^2 |{S_-}|^2 -
\left ({a\over 2{M_{\rm P}}} {S_+}^2 {S_-}^2 + {{{\rm c.c.}}}\right ).\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The terms with <span class="math inline">\(m_+^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_-^2\)</span> are soft squared masses for <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span>. They could come from a minimal supergravity framework at the Planck scale, but in general they will be renormalized differently, due to different interactions for <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span>, which we have not bothered to write down in eq. ([wfordterms]) because they involve fields that will not get VEVs. The last term is a “soft” term analogous to the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> terms in eq. ([lagrsoft]), with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of order <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}\)</span>. The coupling <span class="math inline">\(a/2{M_{\rm P}}\)</span> is actually dimensionless, but should be treated as soft because of its origin and its tiny magnitude. Such terms arise from the supergravity Lagrangian in an exactly analogous way to the usual soft terms. Usually one can just ignore them, but this one plays a crucial role in the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism. The scalar potential for terms containing <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
V =
{1\over 2} g_X^2 \Bigl ( |{S_+}|^2 - |{S_-}|^2 + \sum_i x_i |\phi_i|^2
\Bigr )^2 + V_F + V_{\rm soft}.
\label{xpotential}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> The first term involves the square of the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term [see eqs. ([solveforD]) and ([fdpot])], and <span class="math inline">\(g_X\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> gauge coupling. The scalar potential eq. ([xpotential]) has a nearly <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-flat direction, because the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term part vanishes for <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i=0\)</span> and any <span class="math inline">\(|{S_+}| = |{S_-}|\)</span>. Without loss of generality, we can take <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> to both be real and positive for purposes of minimizing the scalar potential. As long as <span class="math inline">\(a^2 - 6 \lambda^2 (m_+^2 + m_-^2) &gt; 0\)</span>, there is a minimum of the potential very near the flat direction: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\langle {S_+}\rangle^2 \,\approx\, \langle {S_-}\rangle^2
\, \approx \, 
\Bigl [a + \sqrt{ a^2 - 6 \lambda^2 (m_+^2 + m_-^2) } \Bigr ]
{M_{\rm P}}/6 \lambda^2\end{eqnarray}\]</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\langle \phi_i\rangle = 0\)</span>), so <span class="math inline">\(\langle {S_+}\rangle \approx \langle {S_-}\rangle \sim {\cal O}(\sqrt{m_{\rm soft} {M_{\rm P}}})\)</span>. This is also a global minimum of the potential if <span class="math inline">\(a^2 - 8 \lambda^2 (m_+^2 + m_-^2) &gt; 0\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(m_+^2 + m_-^2 &lt; 0\)</span> is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition. The <span class="math inline">\(V_F\)</span> contribution is what stabilizes the scalar potential at very large field strengths. The VEVs of <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> will typically be of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> GeV or so. Therefore the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> gauge boson and gaugino, with masses of order <span class="math inline">\(g_X \langle S_\pm\rangle\)</span>, will play no role in collider physics.</p>
<p>However, there is also necessarily a small deviation from <span class="math inline">\(\langle {S_+}\rangle = \langle {S_-}\rangle\)</span>, as long as <span class="math inline">\(m_+^2 \not= m_-^2\)</span>. At the minimum of the potential with <span class="math inline">\(\partial V/\partial {S_+}= \partial V/\partial {S_-}= 0\)</span>, the leading order difference in the VEVs is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
 \langle {S_+}\rangle^2 - \langle {S_-}\rangle^2 
\,=\, -\langle D_X \rangle/g_X 
\,\approx\,  (m_-^2 - m_+^2)/2 g_X^2,\end{eqnarray}\]</span> assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\langle {S_+}\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle {S_-}\rangle\)</span> are much larger than their difference. After integrating out <span class="math inline">\({S_+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({S_-}\)</span> by replacing them using their equations of motion expanded around the minimum of the potential, one finds that the MSSM scalars <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> each receive a squared-mass correction <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m_i^2 \,=\,  -x_i g_X \langle D_X \rangle\, ,
\label{dxtermcorrections}\end{eqnarray}\]</span> in addition to the usual soft terms from other sources. The <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term corrections eq. ([dxtermcorrections]) can be roughly of the order of <span class="math inline">\(m_{\rm soft}^2\)</span> at most, since they are all proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m_-^2- m_+^2\)</span>. The result eq. ([dxtermcorrections]) does not actually depend on the choice of the non-renormalizable superpotential, as long as it produces the required symmetry breaking with large VEVs; this is a general feature. The most important feature of eq. ([dxtermcorrections]) is that each MSSM scalar squared mass obtains a correction just proportional to its charge <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> under the spontaneously broken gauge group, with a universal factor <span class="math inline">\(g_X \langle D_X \rangle\)</span>. In a sense, the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms <span class="math inline">\(m_+^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_-^2\)</span> have been recycled into a non-zero <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term for <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span>, which then leaves its “fingerprint” on the spectrum of MSSM scalar masses. From the point of view of TeV scale physics, the quantity <span class="math inline">\(g_X \langle D_X \rangle\)</span> can simply be taken to parameterize our ignorance of how <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> got broken. Typically, the charges <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> are rational numbers and do not all have the same sign, so that a particular candidate <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> can leave a quite distinctive pattern of mass splittings on the squark and slepton spectrum. As long as the charges are family-independent, the squarks and sleptons with the same electroweak quantum numbers remain degenerate, maintaining the natural suppression of flavor-mixing effects.</p>
<p>The additional gauge symmetry <span class="math inline">\(U(1)_X\)</span> in the above discussion can stand alone, or may perhaps be embedded in a larger non-Abelian gauge group. If the gauge group for the underlying theory at the Planck scale contains more than one new <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> factor, then each can make a contribution like eq. ([dxtermcorrections]). Additional <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge group factors are quite common in superstring models, and in the GUT groups <span class="math inline">\(SO(10)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_6\)</span>, suggesting optimism about the existence of corresponding <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term corrections. Once one merely assumes the existence of additional <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> gauge groups at very high energies, it is unnatural to assume that such <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions to the MSSM scalar masses should vanish, unless there is an exact symmetry that enforces <span class="math inline">\(m_+^2 = m_-^2\)</span>. The only question is whether or not the magnitude of the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-term contributions is significant compared to the usual minimal supergravity and RG contributions. Therefore, efforts to understand the sparticle spectrum of the MSSM may need to take into account the possibility of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>-terms from additional gauge groups.</p>
<h1 id="sec:outlook"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> Concluding remarks</h1>
<p>In this primer, I have tried to convey some of the more essential features of supersymmetry as a theory of physics beyond the Standard Model. One of the nicest qualities of supersymmetry is that so much is known about its implications already, despite the present lack of direct experimental evidence. The interactions of the Standard Model particles and their superpartners are fixed by supersymmetry, up to mass mixing effects due to supersymmetry breaking. Even the terms and stakes of many of the important outstanding questions, especially the paramount issue “How is supersymmetry broken?”, are already rather clear. That this can be so is a testament to the unreasonably predictive quality of the symmetry itself.</p>
<p>At this writing, LHC searches have been performed based on 5 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 7\)</span> TeV, 20 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 8\)</span> TeV, and 4 fb<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} = 13\)</span> TeV. These searches have not found any evidence for superpartners, and have put strong lower bounds on the masses of squarks and the gluino in large classes of models. Even for the weakly interacting superpartners, the mass limits have begun to exceed those from LEP, in some cases greatly so. The earliest search strategies used by ATLAS and CMS were tuned to simple and optimistic templates, including the the MSUGRA scenario with new parameters <span class="math inline">\(m^2_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span> and Arg<span class="math inline">\((\mu )\)</span>, and the GMSB scenario with new parameters <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_{\rm mess}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({N_5}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tan\beta\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\({\rm Arg}(\mu )\)</span>. However, the only indispensable idea of supersymmetry is simply that of a symmetry between fermions and bosons. Nature may or may not be kind enough to realize this beautiful idea within one of the specific frameworks that have already been explored well by theorists. More recent searches reported by the LHC experimental collaborations probe the more general supersymmetric parameter space, including <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity violating models, and models in which small mass differences or decay modes with softened visible energies make the detection of supersymmetry more difficult.</p>
<p>While the present lack of direct evidence for sparticles is disappointing, it is at least consistent with the observation of <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV. As noted above, this value of the lightest Higgs boson mass points to top squarks that are quite heavy, at least within the MSSM with small or moderate stop mixing. In many model frameworks, the top-squark masses are correlated, through radiative corrections, with the masses of the other squarks and the gluino. Therefore, based only on the information that <span class="math inline">\(m_{h^0} = 125\)</span> GeV, one could have surmised that supersymmetry probably would not be discovered early at the LHC, and that perhaps even with <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{s} =13\)</span> or 14 TeV the discovery of sparticles is not favored, contrary to earlier expectations. A more optimistic inference one could draw is that the MSSM is likely to be augmented with additional particles or interactions that raise the <span class="math inline">\(h^0\)</span> mass, as discussed for example in sections [subsec:variations.vectorlike] and [subsec:variations.NMSSM].</p>
<p>It is also worth nothing that most of the <span><em>other</em></span> theories that had been put forward as solutions to the hierarchy problem are in no better shape than supersymmetry is, given the discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson as well as the lack of other evidence for exotic physics at the LHC in the runs at 7 and 8 TeV. In fact, many of the competitors to supersymmetry in this regard have now been eliminated. Therefore, based on a belief that the hierarchy problem needs a solution at the TeV scale, and the alternatives are less than compelling, I personally maintain a guarded optimism that supersymmetry will be discovered at the LHC in the higher energy runs that have just begun.</p>
<p>If supersymmetry is experimentally verified, the discovery will not be an end, but rather a beginning in high energy physics. It seems likely to present us with questions and challenges that we can only guess at presently. The measurement of sparticle masses, production cross-sections, and decay modes will rule out some models for supersymmetry breaking and lend credence to others. We will be able to test the principle of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-parity conservation, the idea that supersymmetry has something to do with the dark matter, and possibly make connections to other aspects of cosmology including baryogenesis and inflation. Other fundamental questions, like the origin of the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> parameter and the rather peculiar hierarchical structure of the Yukawa couplings may be brought into sharper focus with the discovery of superpartners. Understanding the precise connection of supersymmetry to the electroweak scale will surely open the window to even deeper levels of fundamental physics.</p>

Moreover, perturbative supergravity or superstring predictions for the vacuum energy may not be relevant to the question of whether the observed cosmological constant is sufficiently small.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Some attacks on the hierarchy problem, not reviewed here, are based on the proposition that the ultimate cutoff scale is actually close to the electroweak scale, rather than the apparent Planck scale.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Specifically, <span class="math inline">\(C_H\)</span> is the quadratic Casimir invariant of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_F\)</span> is the Dynkin index of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in a normalization such that <span class="math inline">\(T_F=1\)</span> for a Dirac fermion (or two Weyl fermions) in a fundamental representation of <span class="math inline">\(SU(n)\)</span>.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>For example, if a gauge symmetry were to spontaneously break without breaking supersymmetry, then a massless vector supermultiplet would “eat” a chiral supermultiplet, resulting in a massive vector supermultiplet with physical degrees of freedom consisting of a massive vector (<span class="math inline">\(n_B=3\)</span>), a massive Dirac fermion formed from the gaugino and the chiral fermion (<span class="math inline">\(n_F=4\)</span>), and a real scalar (<span class="math inline">\(n_B=1\)</span>).<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In particular, one cannot attempt to make a spin-1/2 neutrino be the superpartner of the spin-1 photon; the neutrino is in a doublet, and the photon is neutral, under weak isospin.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Other notations in the literature have <span class="math inline">\(H_1, H_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H,{\overline}H\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(H_u, H_d\)</span>. The notation used here has the virtue of making it easy to remember which Higgs VEVs gives masses to which type of quarks.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>A simple way to understand this is to recall that unbroken supersymmetry requires the degeneracy of scalar and fermion masses. Radiative corrections to fermion masses are known to diverge at most logarithmically in any renormalizable field theory, so the same must be true for scalar masses in unbroken supersymmetry.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>This is obviously fuzzy and subjective. Nevertheless, such subjective criteria can be useful, at least on a personal level, for making choices about what research directions to pursue, given finite time and money.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>For obscure reasons, in much of the specialized literature on supersymmetry a bar (<span class="math inline">\(\overline{\psi}\)</span>) has been used to represent the conjugate of a two-component spinor, rather than a dagger (<span class="math inline">\(\psi^\dagger\)</span>). Here, I maintain consistency with essentially all other quantum field theory textbooks by using the dagger notation for the conjugate of a two-component spinor.<a href="#fnref8">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Since <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^{*i}\)</span> appear only quadratically in the action, the result of instead doing a functional integral over them at the quantum level has precisely the same effect.<a href="#fnref9">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>The supersymmetry transformations eqs. ([Atransf])-([Dtransf]) are non-linear for non-Abelian gauge symmetries, since there are gauge fields in the covariant derivatives acting on the gaugino fields and in the field strength <span class="math inline">\(F_{\mu \nu}^a\)</span>. By adding even more auxiliary fields besides <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span>, one can make the supersymmetry transformations linear in the fields; this is easiest to do in superfield language (see sections [subsec:vectorsuperfields], [subsec:superspacelagrabelian], and [subsec:superspacelagrnonabelian]). The version in this section, in which those extra auxiliary fields have been eliminated, is called “Wess-Zumino gauge” <span class="citation" data-cites="WZgauge">@WZgauge</span>.<a href="#fnref10">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Here, the auxiliary fields have been eliminated using their equations of motion (“integrated out”). One can instead give Feynman rules that include the auxiliary fields, or directly in terms of superfields on superspace, although this is usually less practical for phenomenological applications.<a href="#fnref11">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>The factor of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is a convention, not universally chosen in the literature, but adopted here in order to avoid <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> factors in the supersymmetry transformations of section [subsec:susylagr.freeWZ] while maintaining consistency.<a href="#fnref12">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>In this diagram and others below, the arrows on propagators are often omitted for simplicity, and external fermion labels refer to physical particle states rather than 2-component fermion fields.<a href="#fnref13">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>The coupling <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{\prime\prime}\)</span> must be antisymmetric in its last two flavor indices, since the color indices are combined antisymmetrically. That is why the squark in Figure [fig:protondecay] can be <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}{s}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}{b}\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}{d}\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(u,d\)</span> quarks in the proton.<a href="#fnref14">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>The parameter called <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> here is often seen elsewhere as <span class="math inline">\(B\mu\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m_{12}^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m_3^2\)</span>.<a href="#fnref15">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Even the DRED scheme may not provide a supersymmetric regulator, because of either ambiguities or inconsistencies (depending on the precise method) appearing at five-loop order at the latest <span class="citation" data-cites="DREDdies">@DREDdies</span>. Fortunately, this does not seem to cause practical difficulties <span class="citation" data-cites="JJperspective Stockinger">@JJperspective [@Stockinger]</span>. See also ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="Woodard">@Woodard</span> for an interesting proposal that avoids doing violence to the number of spacetime dimensions.<a href="#fnref16">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Actually, there <span><em>is</em></span> vertex renormalization working in a supersymmetric gauge theory in which auxiliary fields have been integrated out, but the sum of divergent contributions for a process always has the form of wave-function renormalization. This is related to the fact that the anomalous dimensions of the superfields differ, by gauge-fixing dependent terms, from the anomalous dimensions of the fermion and boson component fields <span class="citation" data-cites="Jonesreview">@Jonesreview</span>.<a href="#fnref17">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>In GUT models, it is automatic that the gauge couplings and gaugino masses are unified at all scales <span class="math inline">\(Q\geq M_U\)</span>, because in the unified theory the gauginos all live in the same representation of the unified gauge group. In many superstring models, this can also be a good approximation.<a href="#fnref18">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Rescaled soft parameters <span class="math inline">\(A_t = a_t/y_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_b=a_b/y_b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A_\tau=a_\tau/y_\tau\)</span> are often used in the literature. We do not follow this notation, because it cannot be generalized beyond the approximation of eqs. ([heavytopapprox]), ([heavyatopapprox]) without introducing horrible complications such as non-polynomial RG equations, and because <span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\tau\)</span> are the couplings that actually appear in the Lagrangian anyway.<a href="#fnref19">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>The contributions proportional to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are relatively small in most known realistic models.<a href="#fnref20">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>One should think of “<span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2\)</span>” as a parameter unto itself, and not as the square of some mythical real number <span class="math inline">\(m^{\phantom{2}}_{H_u}\)</span>. So there is nothing strange about having <span class="math inline">\(m_{H_u}^2 &lt; 0\)</span>.<a href="#fnref21">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>Non-polynomial superpotential terms, which arise from non-perturbative effects in strongly coupled gauge theories, avoid this requirement.<a href="#fnref22">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>More generally, flat directions, also known as moduli, are non-compact lines and surfaces in the space of scalar fields along which the scalar potential vanishes. The classical renormalizable scalar potential of the MSSM would have many flat directions if supersymmetry were not broken <span class="citation" data-cites="flatdirections">@flatdirections</span>.<a href="#fnref23">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>Actually, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can be different for the different spin contributions, if one chooses a renormalization scheme that does not respect supersymmetry. For example, in the <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\rm MS}}\)</span> scheme, <span class="math inline">\(a = -3/2\)</span> for the spin-0 and spin-<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> contributions, but <span class="math inline">\(a = -5/6\)</span> for the spin-1 contributions. See ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="twoloopEP">@twoloopEP</span> for a discussion, and the extension to two-loop order.<a href="#fnref24">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>More generally, if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by VEVs for several auxiliary fields <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D^a\)</span>, then one should make the replacement <span class="math inline">\(\langle F \rangle \rightarrow ( \sum_i |\langle F_i \rangle|^2 + {1\over 2} \sum_a \langle D^a \rangle^2 )^{1/2}\)</span> everywhere in the following.<a href="#fnref25">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>We do this only to follow popular example; as just noted we cannot endorse this imposition.<a href="#fnref26">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>This <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> may or may not be promoted to a local gauge symmetry at the GUT scale. For our present purposes, it is used only as a classification scheme, since the global <span class="math inline">\(SU(5)\)</span> symmetry is only approximate in the effective theory at the (much lower) messenger mass scale where gauge mediation takes place.<a href="#fnref27">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>The name “sequestered” is often used instead of “hidden” in this context.<a href="#fnref28">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>AMSB can also be realized without invoking extra dimensions. The suppression of flavor-violating MSSM soft terms can instead be achieved using a strongly-coupled conformal field theory near an infrared-stable fixed point <span class="citation" data-cites="AMSBinfourd">@AMSBinfourd</span>.<a href="#fnref29">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>It is often more useful to expand around VEVs <span class="math inline">\(v_u, v_d\)</span> that do not minimize the tree-level potential, for example to minimize the loop-corrected effective potential instead. In that case, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_\pm\)</span> are all slightly different.<a href="#fnref30">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>In general, one-loop 1-particle-reducible tadpole diagrams should also be included. However, they exactly cancel against the tree-level tadpoles, and so both can be omitted, if the VEVs <span class="math inline">\(v_u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_d\)</span> are taken at the minimum of the loop-corrected effective potential (see previous footnote).<a href="#fnref31">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>Other common notations use <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\chi_i^0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}Z_i\)</span> for neutralinos, and <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}\chi^\pm_i\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde}W^\pm_i\)</span> for charginos.<a href="#fnref32">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> defined in eq. ([eq:defS]) vanishes at the input scale for both MSUGRA and GMSB boundary conditions, and remains small under RG evolution.<a href="#fnref33">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>An exception occurs if the mass difference <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde \tau_1} - m_{\tilde N_1}\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tau}\)</span>.<a href="#fnref34">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>A possible exception occurs if the lighter top squark has no kinematically allowed flavor-preserving 2-body decays, which requires <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde t_1} &lt; m_{\tilde N_1} + m_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{\tilde t_1} &lt; m_{\tilde C_1} + m_b\)</span>. Then the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde t_1\)</span> will live long enough to form hadronic bound states. Scalar stoponium might then be observable at the LHC via its rare <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\gamma\)</span> decay, allowing a uniquely precise measurement of the mass through a narrow peak (limited by detector resolution) in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum <span class="citation" data-cites="Drees:1993yr stoponium2">@Drees:1993yr [@stoponium2]</span>.<a href="#fnref35">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>The even more economical case with only <span class="math inline">\(t \sim m_{\rm soft}^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda\)</span> nonzero is also viable and interesting <span class="citation" data-cites="nMSSM">@nMSSM</span>.<a href="#fnref36">↩</a></p></li>
